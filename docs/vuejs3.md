# About the author

Heitor Ramon Ribeiro has been developing web applications for over 15
years, constantly navigating between frontend and backend development.
By following his passion for UX/UI and programming, he chose to stay in
frontend development.

Heitor has built enterprise applications for businesses using Vue.js and the
principles of clean architecture, shifting his course from legacy applications
to the new world of single-page applications (SPAs) and progressive web
applications (PWAs). He thinks that almost anything is possible today with
a browser, and that JavaScript is the future of programming.

When he's not programming or leading a frontend team, he's with his family
having fun, streaming their gaming sessions, or playing some first-person
shooter games.

I would like to thanks my lovely wife, Raquel, for being with me every day helping and supporting me
throughout this process of publishing my first book. To my son, Marco, your father loves you so much
and does everything for you. To my family and friends who helped me during the development of this
book, especially Patrick Monteiro, who helped me a lot.
To all the coworkers and companies that I've worked with over the last few years, who helped me and
understood the importance of this project for me.

# Preface

Vue is a minimal frontend framework that empowers developers to create web
applications, prototypes, big enterprise applications, desktop applications, and
mobile applications.

Vue 3 is a complete rewrite of Vue and brings changes to all the core APIs of
the frameworks. This rewrite changes code that was written to flow in
TypeScript. In Vue 3 we have all of the core APIs exposed, giving the
possibility of using Vue to everyone.

The book starts with recipes for implementing Vue 3's new features in your web
development projects and migrating your existing Vue apps to the latest version.
You will get up and running with TypeScript with Vue, and find succinct
solutions to common challenges and pitfalls faced in implementing components,
derivatives, and animation, through to building plugins, adding state
management, routing, and developing complete single-page applications (SPAs).

Some of the libraries, plugins, and frameworks used in this book might receive
updates between the writing of this book and the time that you're reading it. So,
please pay attention to any API changes or version changes that may have any
breaking changes.


Who this book is for

This book is for web developers who wants to learn more about Vue and wants
to improve their Vue skills. We'll start by presenting the Vue 3 and TypeScript
technologies. In the subsequent chapters, the reader will be presented with the
new concepts in Vue and their ecosystem plugins, UI frameworks, and advanced
recipes.

By following the book from cover to cover, you will be able to create a Vue
application, use all the essential Vue plugins, and employ the top Vue UI
frameworks. If you are already familiar with Vue, you will discover relevant
new patterns.


What this book covers

# Chapter 1, Understanding Vue 3 and Creating Components, provides the reader
with recipes on how to use the new Vue 3 APIs to create custom Vue
components using Vue's exposed core API and the Composition API. This
# chapter also helps the reader along an initial upgrade path of a Vue 2 application
to Vue 3.

# Chapter 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem introduces the reader to
the TypeScript superset and how to use it, starting with basic types, interfaces,
and type annotations. The reader will become ready for the development of a
Vue application with Vue CLI, TypeScript, and vue-class-component.

# Chapter 3, Data Binding, Form Validations, Events, and Computed Properties,
discusses the basic Vue developments and component concepts, including v-
model, event listeners, computed properties, and for loops. The reader will be
introduced to the Vuelidate plugin for form validation and how to use it on a
Vue component, along with how to debug a Vue component with vue-devtools.

# Chapter 4, Components, Mixins, and Functional Components, walks the reader
through building components with different approaches, including custom slots
for contents, validated props, functional components, and creating mixins for
code reusability. It then introduces the reader to a set of different approaches for
accessing child components' data, creating a dependency injection component
and dynamic injected component, and how to lazy load a component.

# Chapter 5, Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests, shows the reader how
to create a custom wrapper around the Fetch API for HTTP calls on JavaScript,
how to use the wrapper in Vue, and how to implement custom asynchronous
functions on Vue. The reader will also learn how to replace the Fetch API in the
wrapper for axios, and how custom handlers can be implemented on axios.

# Chapter 6, Managing Routes with vue-router, takes a look at Vue's routing plugin
and how to use it on Vue to create routes for the pages of a Vue application. It
introduces the process of managing router paths, dynamic paths with parameters


on the router path, lazy loading the page component, creating middleware for
authentication on the router, and using an alias and redirect.

# Chapter 7, Managing the Application State with Vuex, explores the Vue state
management plugin to help the reader understand how Vuex works and how it
can be applied to their application. This chapter also provides the reader with
recipes for creating Vuex modules, actions, mutations, and getters, and explores
how to define the base state for the store.

# Chapter 8, Animating Your Application with Transitions and CSS, explores the
fundamentals of CSS animation and transitions by providing recipes for custom
animations based only on CSS. These will be used with a Vue custom
component to achieve a nice looking application and provide the best experience
for the application's users.

# Chapter 9, Creating Beautiful Applications Using UI Frameworks, take a look at
popular UI frameworks. The reader will build a user registration form with
Buefy, Vuetify, and Ant-Design with their design concept. The aim of the
recipes in this chapter is to teach the reader how to create a good-looking
application with a UI framework.

# Chapter 10, Deploying an Application to Cloud Platforms, shows how to deploy a
Vue application on custom third-party hosters such as Vercel, Netlify, and
Google Firebase. Using the recipes in this chapter, the reader will learn how to
automatically deploy their application with integrated repository hooks and
auto-deploy functions.

# Chapter 11, Pro League – Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More, explores advanced
topics on Vue, including patterns, best practices, how to create plugins and
directives, and how to use high-level frameworks such as Quasar and Nuxt.js to
create applications.

Understanding Vue 3 and Creating
Components

Vue 3 brings a lot of new features and changes for developers, all of them
designed to aid development and improve the framework's overall stability,
speed, and maintainability. Using other frameworks and libraries as
inspiration, the Vue core team managed to achieve a great level of
abstraction on the API where anyone can use Vue now, irrespective of
whether they're a frontend developer or a backend developer.

In this chapter, we will learn how to upgrade our Vue project to the new
version, and more about some of the new Vue features, such as the multiple
root elements, the new attribute inheritance engine, how we can use the
exposed reactivity API outside of Vue in another application, and how to
create a component using the new composition API.

In this chapter, you will learn the following:

What is new in Vue 3
Upgrading your Vue 2 application to Vue 3
Creating components with multiple root elements
Creating components with attribute inheritance
Using the reactivity and observable API outside the scope of Vue
Creating a component using the composition API

What is new in Vue 3

You may be wondering how a new version of a framework could result in
such hype on the internet? Imagine taking a car on the highway, doing a
complete 360 roll, and then continuing to go full speed ahead in the same
direction. This would cause a theatrical scene, and it's the perfect way to
describe how Vue will go from version 2 to 3.


In this first part of the chapter, I will introduce you to the improvements on
Vue, what was added to the framework, what has changed, and how it will
impact the way you code a Vue application.

Improvements to the framework

There are numerous improvements to the Vue framework in this new
release; all of them focused on making the framework better in every way
possible. Here are some of the improvements that can impact the everyday
development and usage of the framework by users and developers.

Under the hood

The outer shell looks the same as the old one, but the engine is a piece of art.
In the new version, there is no leftover code from Vue 2. The core team built
the framework from the ground up using TypeScript and rewrote everything
geared to the maximum performance of the framework.

TypeScript was chosen to create a more maintainable code base for the Vue
core team and the open-source community, and to improve the autocomplete
features, such as IntelliSense or typeahead that the IDEs and code editors
provide, without the need for special plugins and extensions.

Render engine

For Vue 3, a new render engine was developed using a new algorithm for the
shadow DOM. This new render is totally exposed by the core of the
framework by default, without the need to be executed by the framework.
This makes it possible for new implementations of a completely new render
function that can be injected into the framework and replace the original
render engine.

In this new version of Vue, a new template compiler was written from
scratch. This new compiler uses a new technique for cache manipulation
and to manage the rendered elements, and a new hoisted method is applied
to the creation of VNodes.


For cache manipulation, a new method is applied to control the position of
the element, where the element can be a dynamic element with computed
data or a response to a function that can be mutated.

The Vue core team has made an explorer where it's possible to see how the
new template compiler renders the final render function. This can be viewed
at https://vue-next-template-explorer.netlify.app/.

Exposed APIs

With all these modifications, it was possible to render all the Vue APIs
exposed to usage within files outside the scope of application of Vue. It's
possible to use the Vue reactivity or the shadow DOM in a React application,
without the need to render a Vue application inside the React application.
This explosibility is a way of transforming Vue into a more versatile
framework, where it can be used anywhere, not just in frontend
development.

New custom components

Vue 3 introduces three new custom components that can be used by the
developer to resolve old problems. These components were present on Vue 2
but as third-party plugins and extensions. Now they are made by the Vue
core team and added to the Vue core framework.

Fragments

In Vue 2, we always needed to have a parent node wrapping the components
inside the single-file components. This was caused by the way in which the
render engine of Vue 2 was constructed, requiring a root element on each
node.

In Vue 2, we needed to have a wrapper element, encapsulating the elements
that will be rendered. In the example, we have a div HTML element,
wrapping two p HTML child elements, so we can achieve multiple elements
on the page:


<template>
<div>
<p>This is two</p>
<p>children elements</p>
</div>
</template>

Now, in Vue 3, it's possible to declare any number of root elements on the
single-file components without the need for special plugins using the new
Fragments API, which will handle the multiple root elements. This helps to
maintain a cleaner final code for the user, without the need for empty shells
just for wrapping elements:

<template>
<p>This is two</p>
<p>root elements</p>
</template>

As we saw in the Vue 3 code, we were able to have two root p HTML
elements, without the need for a wrapper element.

Teleport

A Teleport component, also known as a Portal component, as the name
implies, is a component that can make an element go from one component to
another. This may seem strange in the first instance, but it has a lot of
applications, including dialogs, custom menus, alerts, badges, and many
other customs UIs that need to appear in special places.

Imagine a header component, where you want a custom slot on the
component so you can place components:

<template>
<header>
<div id="blue-portal" />
</header>
</header>

Then, you want to display a custom button on this header, but you want to
call this button from a page. You just need to execute the following code:

<template>
<page>
<Teleport to="blue-portal">
<button class="orange-portal">Cake</button>


</Teleport>
</page>
</template>

Now, your button will be displayed on the header, but the code will be
executed on the page, giving access to the page scope.

Suspense

When the wait for the data is taking longer than you would like, how about
showing a custom loader for the user? This is now possible without the need
for custom code; Vue will handle this for you. The Suspense component will
manage this process, with a default view once the data is loaded, and a
fallback view when the data is being loaded.

You can write a special wrapper like this:

<template>
<Suspense>
<template #default>
<data-table />
</template>
<template #fallback>
<loading-gears />
</template>
</Suspense>
</template>

The new Vue composition API will understand the current state of your
component, so it will be able to differentiate if the component is loading or if
it's ready to be displayed.

API changes

Some API changes were made in Vue 3 that were necessary in order to clean
the Vue API and simplify development. Some of them are break changes,
and others are additions. But don't worry; the Vue 2 object development was
not removed, it's still there, and will continue to be used. This declaration
method was one of the reasons why many developers choose Vue over other
frameworks.


There are some break changes that will happen in Vue 3 that are important to
learn more about. We will discuss the most important break changes that will
be introduced in Vue 3, and how to deal with then.

In Vue 3, a new way of creating the components is being introduced – the
composition API. This method will make the maintainability of your code
better, and give you a more reliable code, where you will have the full power
of TypeScript available.

Some minor break changes

There are some minor break changes that are present in Vue 3 that need to be
mentioned. These changes relate to one method we used previously to write
code, and that has now been replaced when using Vue 3. It's not a Herculean
job, but you need to know about them.

Goodbye filters, hello filters! The Vue filters API

The way we used filters on Vue 2 is no longer available. The Vue filter has
been removed from the API. This change was made to simplify the render
process and make it faster. All filters, in the end, are functions that receive a
string and return a string.

In Vue 2, we used to use filters like this:

{{ textString | filter }}

Now, in Vue 3, we just need to pass a function to manipulate the string:

{{ filter(textString) }}

The bus just left the station! The event bus API

In Vue 2, we were able to use the power of the global Vue object to create a
new Vue instance, and use this instance as an event bus that could transport
messages between components and functions without any hassle. We just
needed to publish and subscribe to the event bus, and everything was perfect.


This was a good way to transfer data between components, but was an anti-
pattern approach for the Vue framework and components. The correct way to
transfer data between components in Vue is via a parent-child
communication, or state management, also known as state-driven
architecture.

In Vue 3, the $on, $off, and $once instance methods were removed. To use an
event bus strategy now, it is recommended to use a third-party plugin or
framework such as mitt (https://github.com/developit/mitt).

No more global Vue – the mounting API

In Vue 2, we were accustomed to importing Vue, and prior to mounting the
application, use the global Vue instance to add the plugins, filters, components,
router, and store. This was a good technique where we could add anything to
the Vue instance without needing to attach anything to the mounted
application directly. It worked like this:

import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';
import App from './App.vue';

Vue.use(Vuex);
const store = new Vuex.store({});

new Vue({
store,
render: (h) => h(App),
}).$mount('#app');

Now, in Vue 3, this is no longer possible. We need to attach every component,
plugin, store, and router to the mounted instance directly:

import { createApp } from 'vue';
import { createStore } from 'vuex';
import App from './App.vue';

const store = createStore({});

createApp(App)
.use(store)
.mount('#app');

Using this method, we can create different Vue applications in the same
global application, without the plugins, store, or router of the applications






messing with one another.

v-model, v-model, v-model – multiple v-model

When developing a single-file component, we were stuck with a single v-
model directive and a .sync option for a second update change. This meant us
using a lot of custom event emitters and huge object payloads to handle data
inside the component.

In this breaking change, a collateral break change was introduced that resulted in the
model property (https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#model) being removed from the Vue API. This property
is used in custom components that used to do the same thing that the new v-model
directive now does.

The new way to use the v-model directive will change how the sugar syntax
works. In Vue 2, to use a v-model directive, we had to create a component
expecting to receive the props as "value", and when there was a change, we
needed to emit an 'input' event, like the following code:

<template>
<input
:value="value"
@input="$emit('input', $event)"
/>
</template>
<script>
export default {
props: {
value: String,
},
}
</script>

In Vue 3, to make the syntactic sugar work, the props property that the
component will receive and the event emitter will change. Now, the
component expects a props named modelValue and it emits an
event, 'update:modelValue', like the following code:

<template>
<input
:modelValue="modelValue"
v-on:['update:modelValue']="$emit('update:modelValue', $event)"
/>
</template>
<script>
export default {
props: {


modelValue: String,
},
}
</script>

But how about the multiple v-model directives? Understanding the v-model
break change is the first step in getting to know how the new method of
multiple v-model will work.

To create multiple v-model components, we need to create various props with
the name of the model directive we want and emit 'update:value' events where
the value is the name of the model directive:

<script>
export default {
props: {
name: String,
email: String,
},
methods: {
updateUser(name, email) {
this.$emit('update:name', name);
this.$emit('update:email', email);
}
}
}
</script>

In the component where we want to use the multiple v-model directives, use
the following code:

<template>
<custom-component
v-model:name="name"
v-model:email="email"
/>
</template>

The component will have each v-model directive, bounded to the event the
child is emitting. In this case, the child component emits 'update:email' (the
parent component) in order to be able to use the v-model directive with the
email modifier. For example, you can use v-model:email to create the two-way
data binding, between the component and the data.

Composition API


This is one of the most anticipated features of Vue 3. The composition API
is a new way of creating Vue components, with an optimized way of writing
code, and providing full TypeScript type checking support in your
component. This method organizes the code in a simpler and more efficient
way.

In this new way of declaring a Vue component, you just have a setup property
that will be executed and will return everything your component needs in
order to be executed, like this example:

<template>
<p @click="increaseCounter">{{ state.count }}</p>
</template>
<script>
import { reactive, ref } from 'vue';

export default {
setup(){
const state = reactive({
count: ref(0)
});

const increaseCounter = () => {
state.count += 1;
}

return { state, increaseCounter }
}
}
</script>

You will import the reactivity API from the Vue core to enable it in the
object type data property, in this case, state. The ref API enables reactivity in
the basic type value, like count, which is a number.

Finally, the functions can be declared inside the setup functions and passed
down on the returned object. Then, everything is accessible in the <template>
section.

Now, let's move on to some recipes.

Technical requirements

In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue-CLI.





Attention Windows users! You need to install an NPM package called windows-build-tools
to be able to install the following requisite packages. To do this, open Power Shell as an
administrator and execute the following command:
> npm install -g windows-build-tools

To install Vue-CLI, you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global

Creating the base file

In all recipes in this chapter, we will use this base template which we will
create now. Make sure you follow these steps to create the file before
starting the example in the recipe:

1. Create a new .html file in any folder and open it.
2. Create an html tag and add a head HTML element as a child. Inside

the head HTML element, add a script HTML element with
the src attribute defined as http://unpkg.com/vue@next:

<html>
<head>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
</head>
</html>

3. As a sibling of the  head HTML element, create a body HTML element.
Inside the body HTML element, add a div HTML element with the
attribute id defined as "app":

<body>
<div id="app">
</div>
</body>

4. Finally, as a sibling of the div HTML element, create a script HTML

element, with empty content. This will be where we will place the code
for the recipes:

<script></script>


Upgrading your Vue 2 application
to Vue 3

Upgrading your project from Vue 2 to Vue 3 can sometimes be done
automatically, but in other cases, this needs to be done manually. This
depends on how deep into the use of the Vue API you go with your
application.

With projects made and managed by Vue-CLI, this process will be made
seamlessly and will have a more straightforward approach compared to
projects using a custom framework wrapper CLI.

In this recipe, you will learn how to upgrade your application using Vue-CLI
and how to upgrade the project and the dependencies manually.

Getting ready

The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

In order to upgrade your Vue 2 project to Vue 3, you will have to split the
upgrade into different parts. We have the upgrade of the framework itself,
and then we have the ecosystem components, such as vue-router and vuex, and
finally, the bundler that joins everything in the end.

The framework upgrade comes with break changes. There are some break changes that
are presented in this book in the What is new in Vue 3 section of this chapter, and others


that may occur in a more advanced API schema. You have to manually update and check
whether your components are valid for the upgrade on the framework.

Using Vue-CLI to upgrade the project

Using the latest version of Vue-CLI, you will be able to use Vue 3 in your
project, out of the box, and you will be able to update your current project to
Vue 3.

To update Vue-CLI to the latest version, you need to open Terminal (macOS
or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the
following command:

> npm install @vue/cli-service@latest

Upgrading the project manually

To upgrade the project manually, you will have to first upgrade the project
dependencies to their latest versions. You cannot use an old version of a Vue
ecosystem plugin with Vue 3. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. We need to upgrade the Vue framework, the ESLint plugin (which Vue
depends on), and the vue-loader for the bundler. To upgrade it, you need
to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell
(Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm install vue@next eslint-plugin-vue@next vue-loader@next

2. We need to add the new Vue single-file component compiler as a

dependency to the project. To install it, you need to open
Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell
(Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm install @vue/compiler-sfc@latest

3. If you are using unit tests and the @vue/test-utils package on your

project, you will also need to upgrade this dependency. To upgrade it,
you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:


> npm install @vue/test-utils@next @vue/server-test-utils@latest

4. For the Vue ecosystem plugins, if you are using vue-router, you will need
to upgrade this too. To upgrade it, you need to open Terminal (macOS
or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the
following command:

> npm install vue-router@next

5. If your application is using vuex as the default state management, you

will need to upgrade this too. To upgrade it, you need to open
Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell
(Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm install vuex@next

Changing the starting files

With the new version of the packages, we will need to change our starting
files. In a Vue project that was created with the Vue-CLI starter kit, you will
find a file named main.js or main.ts. If you are using TypeScript, this file is
located in the src folder. Now follow these instructions:

1. Open the main.js file in the src folder of your project. At the top of the

file, where the packages are imported, you will see the following code:

import Vue from 'vue';

We need to change this to the new Vue exposed API method. To do
this, we need to import createApp from the Vue package as follows:

import { createApp } from 'vue';

2. Remove the global Vue static attribute definition of

Vue.config.productionTip from your code.

3. The mounting function of your application needs to be changed. The

old API will look like this:

new Vue({
router,
store,


render: (h) => h(App),
}).$mount('#app');

The old API should be changed to the new createApp API, as follows:

createApp(App)
.use(router)
.use(store)
.mount('#app')

4. Open your vuex store instantiation file (normally, this file is located

in src/store and is named store.js or index.js).

5. Change the creation of the store from the instantiation of a new vuex
class to the new createStore API. The vuex v3 class instantiation may
look like this:

import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';

Vue.use(Vuex);

export default new Vuex.Store({
state: { /* ... */ },
mutations: { /* ... */ },
actions: { /* ... */ },
getters: { /* ... */ },
modules: { /* ... */ },
});

You need to replace its content with the createStore API, which could
look like this, for example:

import { createStore } from 'vuex';

export default createStore({
state: { /* ... */ },
mutations: { /* ... */ },
actions: { /* ... */ },
getters: { /* ... */ },
modules: { /* ... */ },
});

6. In the vue-router ecosystem, we will need to replace the old API from the
router creation with the new one. To do this, open the router creation
file (in the src/router folder, normally named router.js or index.js).

7. Finally, in the creation file, replace the old vue-router class instantiation
with the new createRouter API. The vue-router v3 class instantiation may
look like this:





import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';

Vue.use(VueRouter);

export default new VueRouter({
routes: [{
path: '/',
name: 'HomePage',
component: () => import('pages/home'),
}]
});

You will also need to replace the new VueRouter instantiation with the
new createRouter and createWebHistory API, as in this example:

import {
createRouter,
createWebHistory,
} from 'vue-router';

Vue.use(VueRouter);

export default createRouter({
history: createWebHistory(),
routes: [{
path: '/',
name: 'HomePage',
component: () => import('pages/home'),
}]
});

How it works...

In the upgrading process, Vue has provided us with two ways to update our
project. The first way is to use the Vue-CLI plugin, which tries to automate
almost all the processes and changes needed for the upgrade.

The second way is to upgrade the project manually. This method requires the
developer to upgrade all the dependencies to the latest version, install the
new single-file component compiler, @vue/compiler-sfc, and change the entry
files for the Vue application, router, and store to the new API.

Following the changes to the starter structure of the project, the developer
needs to check the components to see whether there are any Vue 3 breaking
changes present, refactor the component to the new Vue 3 APIs, and remove
the deprecated APIs from Vue 2.






Creating components with multiple
root elements

In Vue 3, it is possible to create components with multiple root elements,
without the need for a wrapping element. This option is also known as
a fragment.

In React, this has been possible for a long time, but in Vue, you need to use
custom third-party plugins such as vue-fragment (https://github.com/Thunberg087/vu
e-fragment) to use this feature.

In this recipe, you will learn how to create a component with multiple root
elements, and how it could be used with a <template> section and a render
function.

How to do it...

In this recipe, we will create two examples of a multiple root element
component, one with a <template> structure, and another with a render function.
To do this, this recipe will be divided into two parts.

Creating the component with the <template> structure

In order to use the <template> structure in our example, we will be using the
template property of the Vue object where we can pass a string or a template
string as the value, which will be interpolated by the Vue script and rendered
on the screen:

1. Using the base example from the 'Creating the base file' section, create

a new file named template.html and open it.

2. In the empty <script> HTML element, create the

constants defineComponent and createApp by object-destructuring the Vue
global constant:


const {
defineComponent,
createApp,
} = Vue;

3. Create a constant named component, defined as the defineComponent method,
passing a JavaScript object as an argument with three properties: data,
methods, and template:

const component = defineComponent({
data: () => ({}),
methods: {},
template: ``
});

4. In the data property, define it as a singleton function, returning a

JavaScript object, with a property named count and with the default
value as 0:

data: () => ({
count: 0
}),

5. In the methods property, create a property called addOne, which is a

function that will increase the value of count by 1:

methods: {
addOne() {
this.count += 1;
},
},

6. In the template property, in the template string, create an h1 HTML

element with a title. Then, as a sibling, create a button HTML element
with an event listener bound to the click event, triggering the addOne
function when executed:

template: `
<h1>
This is a Vue 3 Root Element!
</h1>
<button @click="addOne">
Pressed {{ count }} times.
</button>
`

7. Finally, call the createApp function, passing the component constant as an

argument. Then, prototype chain the mount function and, as an argument


of the function, pass the div HTML element id attribute, ("#app"):

createApp(component)
.mount('#app');

Creating the component with the render function

In order to use the <template> structure in our example, we will be using
the template property of the Vue object, where we can pass a string or a
template string as the value, which will be interpolated by the Vue script and
rendered on the screen:

1. Using the base example from the 'Creating the base file' section, create

a new file named render.html and open it.

2. In the empty <script> HTML element, create the constants of the

functions that will be used using the object destructuring method,
calling the defineComponent, h, and createApp methods from the Vue global
constant:

const {
defineComponent,
h,
createApp,
} = Vue;

3. Create a constant named component, defined as the defineComponent method,

passing a JavaScript object as an argument with three
properties: data, methods, and render:

const component = defineComponent({
data: () => ({}),
methods: {},
render() {},
});

4. In the data property, define it as a singleton function, returning a

JavaScript object with a property named count and with the default value
as 0:

data: () => ({
count: 0
}),


5. In the methods property, create a property called addOne, which is a

function that will increase the value of count by 1:

methods: {
addOne() {
this.count += 1;
},
},

6. In the render property, perform the following steps:

Create a constant named h1 and define it as the h function, passing
'h1' as the first argument, and the title that will be used as the
second argument.
Create a constant named button, which will be the h function,
passing "button" as the first argument, a JavaScript object with the
property onClick with a value of this.addOne as the second
argument, and the content of button as the third argument.
Return an array, with the first value as the h1 constant, and the
second value as the button constant:

render() {
const h1 = h('h1', 'This is a Vue 3 Root Element!');
const button = h('button', {
onClick: this.addOne,
}, `Pressed ${this.count} times.`);

return [
h1,
button,
];
},

7. Finally, call the createApp function, passing the component constant as an
argument, prototype chaining the mount function, and passing the div
HTML element id attribute, ("#app"), as an argument of the function:

createApp(component)
.mount('#app');

How it works...

The new Vue component creation API needs to be executed by a
function, defineComponent, and the JavaScript object that is passed as an
argument maintains almost the same structure as the old structure in Vue 2.



In the examples, we used the same properties, data, render, methods, and
template, all present in Vue 2.

In the example with the <template> structure, we didn't have to create a
wrapper element to encapsulate the content of our application component
and were able to have two root elements on the component directly.

In the render function example, the same behavior occurs, but the final
example used the new exposed h API, where it is no longer a parameter of
the render function. A breaking change was present in the example; in the
button creation, we had to use the onClick property inside the data JavaScript
object, not the on property, with the click method. This happens because of
the new data structure of the VNode of Vue 3.

Creating components with attribute
inheritance

Since Vue 2, it has been possible to use attribute inheritance on components,
but in Vue 3, attribute inheritance was made better and with a more reliable
API to use in the components.

Attribute inheritance in components is a pattern that provides faster
development of custom components based on HTML elements (such as
custom inputs, buttons, text wrappers, or links).

In this recipe, we will create a custom input component with attribute
inheritance applied directly to the input HTML element.

How to do it...

Here, we will create a component that will have a full attribute inheritance
on a selected element on the DOM tree:


1. Using the base example from the Creating the base file section, create a

new file named component.html and open it.

2. In the empty <script> HTML element, create the constants of the

functions that will be used using the object destructuring method,
calling the defineComponent and createApp methods from the Vue global
constant:

const {
defineComponent,
createApp,
} = Vue;

3. Create a constant named nameInput, defined as the defineComponent method,

passing a JavaScript object as an argument with four
properties: name, props, template, and inheritAttrs. Then, we define the
value of inheritAttrs as false:

const nameInput = defineComponent({
name: 'NameInput',
props: {},
inheritAttrs: false,
template: ``
});

4. In the props property, add a property called modelValue and define it as

String:

props: {
modelValue: String,
},

5. In the template property, within the template string, we need to do the

following:

Create a label HTML element and add an input HTML element as a
child.
In the input HTML element, define the v-bind directive as a
JavaScript object with the destructed value of this.$attrs.
Define the variable attribute value as the received prop's modelValue.
Set the input attribute type as "text".
To the change event listener, add an anonymous function, which
receives an event as the argument, and then emit an event called
"update:modeValue" with the payload event.target.value:


template: `
<label>
<input
v-bind="{
...$attrs,
}"
:value="modelValue"
type="text"
@change="(event) => $emit('update:modelValue',
event.target.value)"
/>
</label>`

6. Create a constant named appComponent, defined as

the defineComponent method, passing a JavaScript object as an
argument with two properties, data and template:

const component = defineComponent({
data: () => ({}),
template: ``,
});

7. In the data property, define it as a singleton function, returning a

JavaScript object with a property named name, with the default value
as '':

data: () => ({
name: ''
}),

8. In the template property, within the template string, we need to do the

following:

Create a NameInput component with a v-model directive bounded to
the name data property.
Create a style attribute with the value "border:0; border-bottom: 2px
solid red;".
Create a data-test attribute with the value "name-input":

template: `
<name-input
v-model="name"
style="border:0; border-bottom: 2px solid red;"
data-test="name-input"
/>`

9. Create a constant named app, and define it as the createApp function,

passing the component constant as the argument. Then, call the
app.component function, passing as the first argument the name of the


component you want to register, and as the second argument the
component. Finally, call the app.mount function, passing "#app" as the
argument:

const app = createApp(component);
app.component('NameInput', nameInput);
app.mount('#app');

How it works...

In Vue 3, in order to create a component, we need to execute
the defineComponent function, passing a JavaScript object as an argument. This
object maintains almost the same component declaration structure as Vue 2.
In the examples, we used the same properties, data, methods, props, and template,
all present in the V2.

We used the inheritAttrs property to block the auto application of the
attributes to all elements on the components, applying them just to the
element with the v-bind directive and with the this.$attrs object
deconstructed.

To register the component in the Vue application, we first created the
application with the createApp API and then executed the app.component function
to register the component globally on the application, prior to rendering our
application.

Using the reactivity and observable
API outside the scope of Vue

In Vue 3, with the exposed APIs, we can use the Vue reactivity and reactive
variables without the need to create a Vue application. This enables backend
and frontend developers to take full advantage of the Vue reactivity API
within their application.


In this recipe, we will create a simple JavaScript animation using the
reactivity and watch APIs.

How to do it...

Here, we will create an application using the Vue exposed reactivity API to
render an animation on the screen:

1. Using the base example from the 'Creating the base file' section, create

a new file named reactivity.html and open it.

2. In the <head> tag, add a new <meta> tag with the attribute chartset defined

as "utf-8":

<meta charset="utf-8"/>

3. In the <body> tag, remove the div#app HTML element, and create a div
HTML element with the id defined as marathon and the style attribute
defined as "font-size: 50px;":

<div
id="marathon"
style="font-size: 50px;"
>
</div>

4. In the empty <script> HTML element, create the constants of the

functions that will be used using the object destructuring method,
calling the reactivity and watch methods from the Vue global constant:

const {
reactive,
watch,
} = Vue;

5. Create a constant named mod, defined as a function, which receives two
arguments, a and b. This then returns an arithmetic operation, a modulus
b:

const mod = (a, b) => (a % b);

6. Create a constant named maxRoadLength with the value 50. Then, create a
constant named competitor with the value as the reactivity function,


passing a JavaScript object as the argument, with the position
property defined as 0 and speed defined as 1:

const maxRoadLength = 50;
const competitor = reactive({
position: 0,
speed: 1,
});

7. Create a watch function, passing an anonymous function as the

argument. Inside the function, do the following:

Create a constant named street, and define it as an Array with a size
of maxRoadLength, and fill it with '_'.
Create a constant named marathonEl, and define it as the HTML
DOM node, #marathon.
Select the element on the street in the array index

of competitor.position and define it as "

" if

" if the number is odd.

the competitor.position number is even, or "
Define marathonEl.innertHTML as "" and street.reverse().join(''):

The emojis used in this recipe are Person Running and Person Walking. The emoji
image may vary depending on your OS. The images presented in this recipe are the
emojis for the Apple OS.

watch(() => {
const street = Array(maxRoadLength).fill('_');
const marathonEl = document.getElementById('marathon');
street[competitor.position] = (competitor.position % 2 === 1)

? '

'

: '

';

marathonEl.innerHTML = '';
marathonEl.innerHTML = street.reverse().join('');
});

8. Create a setInterval function, passing an anonymous function as the

argument. Inside the function, define competitor.position as the
mod function, passing competitor.position plus competitor.speed as the first
argument, and maxRoadLength as the second argument:

setInterval(() => {
competitor.position = mod(competitor.position +competitor.speed,



maxRoadLength)
}, 100);

How it works...

Using the exposed reactive and watch APIs from Vue, we were able to create
an application with the reactivity present in the Vue framework, but without
the use of a Vue application.

First, we created a reactive object, competitor, that works in the same way as
the Vue data property. Then, we created a watch function, which works in the
same way as the watch property, but is used as an anonymous function. In the
watch function, we made the road for the competitor to run on, and created a
simple animation, using two different emojis, changing it based on the
position on the road, so that it mimics an animation on the screen.

Finally, we printed the current runner on the screen and created a
setInterval function of every 100ms to change the position of the competitor on
the road:


Creating a component using the
composition API

The composition API is a new way to write Vue components, based on the
use of functions to compose the component, and it makes the organization
and reusability of the code better.

This method is inspired by React Hooks and introduces the technique of
creating a special function to compose the applications that can be shared
without the need to be inside the Vue application because of the use of the
exposed Vue APIs.

In this recipe, we will learn how to create an external function that fetches
the user's geolocation and displays that data on the screen using the


composition API.

How to do it...

Here, we will create a component using the composition API, which will
fetch the user GPS position and show that information on the screen:

1. Using the base example from the 'Creating the base file' section, create

a new file named component.html and open it.

2. In the empty <script> HTML element, create the constants of the

functions that will be used using the object destructuring method,
calling the createApp, defineComponent, setup, ref, onMounted, and onUnmounted
methods from the Vue global constant:

const {
createApp,
defineComponent,
setup,
ref,
onMounted,
onUnmounted,
} = Vue;

3. Create a fetchLocation function and, inside this, create a let variable

named watcher. Then, create a constant named geoLocation and define it
as navigator.geolocation. Next, create a constant named gpsTime and define
it as the ref function, passing the Date.now() function as the argument.
Finally, create a constant named coordinates and define it as the ref
function, passing a JavaScript object as the argument, with the
properties accuracy, latitude, longitude, altitude, altitudeAccuracy, heading, and
speed defined as 0:

function fetchLocation() {
let watcher;
const geoLocation = navigator.geolocation;
const gpsTime = ref(Date.now());
const coordinates = ref({
accuracy: 0,
latitude: 0,
longitude: 0,
altitude: 0,
altitudeAccuracy: 0,
heading: 0,
speed: 0,
});
}


4. Then, inside the fetchLocation function, following the creation of the

constants, create a function named setPosition with a parameter named
payload. Inside the function, define gpsTime.value as the
payload.timestamp argument and coordinates.value as the
payload.coords argument:

function setPosition(payload) {
gpsTime.value = payload.timestamp
coordinates.value = payload.coords
}

5. Following creation of the setPosition function, call the onMounted function,
passing an anonymous function as the argument. Inside the function,
check whether the browser has the geoLocation API available, and
define watcher as the geoLocation.watchPostion function, passing the
setPosition function as the argument:

onMounted(() => {
if (geoLocation) watcher = geoLocation.watchPosition(setPosition);
});

6. After calling the onMounted function, create an onUnmounted function

passing an anonymous function as the argument. Inside the function,
check whether watcher is defined and then execute the
geoLocation.clearWatch function, passing watcher as the argument:

onUnmounted(() => {
if (watcher) geoLocation.clearWatch(watcher);
});

7. Finally, in the fetchLocation function, return a JavaScript object, and as
the properties/values define, pass the coordinates and gpsTime constants:

return {
coordinates,
gpsTime,
};

8. Create a constant named appComponent and define it as the

defineComponent function, passing a JavaScript object with the
properties setup and template as the argument:

const appComponent = defineComponent({
setup() {},
template: ``
});


9. In the setup function, create a constant, which is an object destructuring
with the properties coordinates and gpsTime of the fetchLocation function:

setup() {
const {
coordinates,
gpsTime,
} = fetchLocation();
}

10. Inside the setup function, create another constant named formatOptions,

and define it as a JavaScript object with the
properties year, month, day, hour, and minute as 'numeric'. Then, define the
property hour12 as true:

const formatOptions = {
year: 'numeric',
month: 'numeric',
day: 'numeric',
hour: 'numeric',
minute: 'numeric',
hour12: true,
};

11. Following the creation of the formatOptions constant, create a constant

named formatDate and define it as a function, which receives a parameter
named date. Then, return a new Intl.DateTimeFormat function,
passing navigator.language as the first argument, and the formatOption
constant as the second argument. Then, prototype chain the format
function, passing the date parameter:

const formatDate = (date) => (new
Intl.DateTimeFormat(navigator.language,
formatOptions).format(date));

12. Finally, at the end of the setup function, return a JavaScript object with
the properties defined as coordinates, gpsTime, and formatDate constants:

return {
coordinates,
gpsTime,
formatDate
};

13. In the template property, do the following:

Create an h1 HTML element with the text "My Geo Position at {{
formatDate(new Date(gpsTime) }}".


Create a ul HTML element and add three li HTML elements as
children.
In the first child element, add the text "Latitude: {{
coordinates.latitude }}".
In the second child element, add the text "Longitude: {{
coordinates.longitude }}".
In the third child element, add the text "Altitude: {{
coordinates.altitude }}":

template: `
<h1>My Geo Position at {{formatDate(new
Date(gpsTime))}}</h1>
<ul>
<li>Latitude: {{ coordinates.latitude }}</li>
<li>Longitude: {{ coordinates.longitude }}</li>
<li>Altitude: {{ coordinates.altitude  }}</li>
</ul>
`

14. Finally, call the createApp function, passing the appComponent constant as an
argument. Then, prototype chain the mount function, and, as an argument
of the function, pass the div HTML element id attribute, ("#app"):

createApp(appComponent)
.mount('#app');

How it works...

In this recipe, first, we imported the exposed APIs
- createApp,  defineComponent, setup, ref, onMounted, and onUnmounted, – as constants,
which we will use to create the component. Then, we created the fetchLocation
function, which has the responsibility of getting the user's geolocation data
and returning it as reactive data that can be automatically updated when the
user changes their location.

The ability to fetch the user GPS positions was possible because of
the navigator.geolocation API present on modern browsers, which are able to
fetch the user's current GPS position. Using this data provided by the
browser, we were able to use it to define the variables created with the Vue
ref APIs.


We created the component using the setup function of the Vue object
declaration, so the rendering knows that we are using the new composition
API as the component creation method. Inside the setup function, we
imported the dynamic variables of the fetchLocation function and created a
method that formats the date to use as a filter on the template.

Then we returned the imported variables and the filter, so they can be used
on the template section. In the template section, we created a title adding the
time of the last GPS position, used the filter to format it, and created a list of
the user's latitude, longitude, and altitude.

Finally, we created the application using the createApp exposed API and
mounted the Vue application.

Introducing TypeScript and the Vue
Ecosystem

TypeScript is a new Vue-based language, fully supported on Vue 3. It is now
possible to use typed JSX (also know as TSX), type annotation, static verification
of the code, and much more.

The Vue ecosystem is getting bigger each day, so to help us, the Vue team has
developed some tools to improve project handling and management. Those tools
are Vue CLI and Vue UI, which today are the main tools for local Vue
development.

The Vue CLI tool is the beginning of every project; with it, you will be able to
select the basic features or just a preset you had made, to create a new Vue project.
After a project is created, you can use Vue UI to manage the project, add new
features, check the status of the project, and do almost everything you previously
needed to do in the command-line interface (CLI), with the addition of more
features.

In these chapters, you learn more about TypeScript as a superset on JavaScript and
how to use the power of the Vue CLI tool and Vue UI together to get a whole
application up and running.

In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:

Creating a TypeScript project
Understanding TypeScript
Creating your first TypeScript class
Creating your first project with Vue CLI
Adding plugins to a Vue CLI project with Vue UI
Adding TypeScript to a Vue CLI project
Creating your first TypeScript Vue component with vue-class-component
Creating a custom mixin with vue-class-component
Creating a custom function decorator with vue-class-component
Adding custom hooks to vue-class-component
Adding vue-property-decorator to vue-class-component


Technical requirements

In this chapter, we will be using Node.js, Vue CLI, and TypeScript.

Attention, Windows users—you need to install an npm package called windows-build-tools to be
able to install the following required packages. To do it, open PowerShell as administrator and
execute the following command:
> npm install -g windows-build-tools.

To install the Vue CLI tool, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global

To install TypeScript, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm install -g typescript

Creating a TypeScript project

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that, when compiled, gives us plain
JavaScript code. It seems like a new language, but in the end, it's still JavaScript.

What is the advantage of using TypeScript? The main advantage is the typed
syntax, which helps with static checking and code refactoring. You can still use all
the JavaScript libraries and program with the latest ECMAScript features out of
the box.

When compiled, TypeScript will deliver a pure JavaScript file that can run on any
browser, Node.js, or any JavaScript engine that is capable of executing
ECMAScript 3 or newer versions.

Getting ready

To start our project, we will need to create an npm project. Open Terminal (macOS
or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> npm init -y


You also need to install TypeScript, so open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm install typescript --only=dev

How to do it...

With our environment ready, we will need to start our TypeScript project. Let's
create a .ts file and compile it:

1. To start our TypeScript project, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> tsc --init

This will create a tsconfig.json file inside our folder. This is a compiler
settings file. Here, you can define the target, which JavaScript libraries will
be available on the development, the target ECMAScript version, the
module generation, and much more.

When developing for the web, don't forget to add the Document Object Model (DOM) to the
libraries on the compilerOption property inside the tsconfig.json file so that you can have access to
the window and document object when developing.

2. Now, we need to create our index.ts file. Let's create some simple code inside

the index.ts file that will log a math calculation in your terminal:

function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
return a + b;
}

const firstNumber: number = 10;

const secondNumber: number = 20;

console.log(sum(firstNumber, secondNumber));

This function receives two parameters, a and b, which both have their type
set to number, and the function is expected to return a number. We made two
variables, firstNumber and secondNumber, which in this case are both set to a
number type—10 and 20 respectively—so, it's valid to pass to the function. If
we had set it to any other type such as a string, Boolean, float, or an array,
the compiler would have thrown an error about the static type checking on
the variable and the function execution.





3. Now, we need to compile this code to a JavaScript

file. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> tsc ./index.ts

After the compilation, we can see the final file in index.js. If we look inside the
file, the final code will be similar to this:

function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
var firstNumber = 10;
var secondNumber = 20;
console.log(sum(firstNumber, secondNumber));

You may be wondering: where are my types? As ECMAScript is a dynamic
language, the types of TypeScript exist only at the superset level, and won't be
passed down to the JavaScript file.

Your final JavaScript will be in the form of a transpiled file, with the
configurations defined in the tsconfig.json file.

How it works...

When we create our TypeScript project, a file named tsconfig.json is created inside
our folder. This file coordinates all the rules on the compiler and the static type
checking during the development process. All developments are based on the rules
defined in this file. Each environment depends on specific rules and libraries that
need to be imported.

When developing, we can assign types directly to constants, variables, function
parameters, returns, and much more. These types of definitions can prevent basic
type errors and code refactoring.

After the development is done and we compile the project, the final product will
be a pure JavaScript file. This file won't have any type of checking, due to the
dynamic type of JavaScript.

This JavaScript file gets transpiled to the target model and defined on the
configuration file, so we can execute it without any problems.

Understanding TypeScript

TypeScript is a type-based language. Much of its power comes with the ability to
use static code analysis with JavaScript. This is possible thanks to the tools that
exist inside the TypeScript environment.

These tools include the compiler, which can provide static analysis during
development and after compilation, and the ECMAScript transpiler, which can
make your code available to run on almost any JavaScript engine.

Let's get to know more about the language, and how it works.

Getting ready

To start, we will need to create an npm project. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm init -y

You also need to install TypeScript, so open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm install typescript --only=dev

Types


The main feature we get from using TypeScript is the types. In this section, we
will learn about types, how to declare them, and how to use them.

These are some of the basic types in a statically typed language:

String
Number
Boolean
Arrays
Tuple
Enum
Any
Void
Objects

Let's talk about some of these types and show how they can be used in
TypeScript.

String

All the textual data on JavaScript will be treated as a string. To declare a
string, we always need to surround it with double (") or single (') quotes, or the (`)
grave accent, commonly known as a template string.

Declaring template strings inside text is not a problem with TypeScript. Template
strings are a feature in ECMAScript that made it possible to add a variable inside a
string without the need for concatenation:

const myText: string = 'My Simple Text';
const myTextAgain: string = "My Simple Text";
const greeting: string = `Welcome back ${myName}!`;

Number

In JavaScript, all numbers are floating-point values. In TypeScript, it's the same.
Those numbers get a number type. In addition to the hexadecimal and decimal
numbers, the binary and octal literals that were introduced in ECMAScript 2015
are treated like numbers too:

const myAge: number = 31;
const hexNumber: number = 0xf010d;
const binaryNumber: number = 0b1011;
const octalNumber: number = 0o744;


Boolean

The most basic type in the programming languages is the boolean values—a
simple 1 or 0, and true or false. This is called a boolean:

const isTaskDone: boolean = false;
const isGreaterThen: boolean = 10 > 5;

Arrays

A group of elements in most of the languages is commonly called an array. In
TypeScript, we can declare it in two different ways.

The most simple way is just to declare the type of the element followed by
[] (square brackets) to denote that it is an array of the declared type:

const primeNumbers: number[] = [1, 3, 5, 7, 11];

Or, you can declare generically, using the Array<type> declaration. This is not the
most common way used, but, depending on the code you are developing, you may
need to use it:

const switchInstructions: Array<boolean> = [true, false, false, true];

Tuple

Tuples are a type of variable that has a specific structure. Structurally, a tuple is an
array of two elements; both are a known type by the compiler and the user, but
those elements don't need to have the same type:

let person: [string, number];
person = ['Heitor', 31];

console.log(`My name is ${person[0]} and I am ${person[1]} years old`);

If you try to access an element outside of the known indices, you will get an error.

Enum

Enums are similar to JavaScript objects, but they have some special attributes that
help in the development of your application. You can have a friendly name for
numeric values or a more controlled environment for the constants on the
variables a function can accept.



A numeric enum can be created without any declaration. By doing this, it will start
with the initial values of 0 and finish with the value of the final index number; or,
you can get the name of the enum, passing the index of the enum value:

enum ErrorLevel {
Info,
Debug,
Warning,
Error,
Critical,
}

console.log(ErrorLevel.Error); // 3
console.log(ErrorLevel[3]); // Error

Or, an enum can be declared with values. It can be an initial declaration that the
TypeScript compiler will interpret the rest of the elements as an increment of the
first one, or an individual declaration:

enum Color {
Red = '#FF0000',
Blue = '#0000FF',
Green = '#00FF00',
}

enum Languages {
JavaScript = 1,
PHP,
Python,
Java = 10,
Ruby,
Rust,
TypeScript,
}

console.log(Color.Red) // '#FF0000'
console.log(Languages.TypeScript) // 13

Any

As JavaScript is a dynamic language, TypeScript needed to implement a type that
has no defined value, so it implemented the any type. The most used case for the
any type any is when using values that came from a third-party library. In that
case, we know that we are dropping the type checking:

let maybeIs: any = 4;
maybeIs = 'a string?';
maybeIs = true;

The main use of the any type is when you are upgrading a legacy JavaScript
project to TypeScript, and you can gradually add the types and validations to the
variables and functions.





Void

As the opposite of any, void is the absence of the type at all. The most used case
is with functions that won't return any values:

function logThis(str: string): void{
console.log(str);
}

Using void to type a variable is useless because it only can be assigned to
undefined and null.

Objects

An object in TypeScripts has a special form of declaring because it can be
declared as an interface, as a direct object, or as a type of its own.

Declaring an object as an interface, you have to declare the interface before using
it, all the attributes must be passed, and the types need to be set:

interface IPerson {
name: string;
age: number;
}

const person: IPerson = {
name: 'Heitor',
age: 31,
};

Using objects as direct inputs is sometimes common when passing to a function:

function greetingUser(user: {name: string, lastName: string}) {
console.log(`Hello, ${user.name} ${user.lastName}`);
}

And finally, they are used for declaring a type of object and reusing it:

type Person = {
name: string,
age: number,
};

const person: Person = {
name: 'Heitor',
age: 31,
};

console.log(`My name is ${person.name}, I am ${person.age} years old`);

Functions





In TypeScript, one of the most difficult types to declare is a function. It can get
very complex in a just simple concatenation of the functional chain.

Declaring a function in TypeScript is a composition of the parameters that the
function will receive and the final type that the function will return.

You can declare a simple function inside a constant, like this:

const sumOfValues: (a:number, b:number): number = (a: number, b: number): number => a +
b;

A more complex function declared inside a constant can be declared like this:

const complexFunction: (a: number) => (b:number) => number = (a: number): (b: number) =>
number => (b: number): number => a + b;

When declaring a function as a normal function, the way to type it is almost the
same as in a constant way, but you don't need to declare that the functions are a
function. Here is an example:

function foo(a: number, b:number): number{
return a + b;
}

Interfaces

TypeScript checks that the values of variables are the correct type and the same
principle is applied to classes, objects, or contracts between your code. This is
commonly known as "duck typing" or "structural sub-typing". Interfaces exist to
fill this space and define these contracts or types.

Let's try to understand an interface with this example:

function greetingStudent(student: {name: string}){
console.log(`Hello ${student.name}`);
}

const newStudent = {name: 'Heitor'};

greetingStudent(newStudent);

The function will know that the object has the property name on it and that it's
valid to call it.

We can rewrite it with the interface type for better code management:




interface IStudent {
name: string;
course?: string;
readonly university: string;
}

function greetingStudent(student: IStudent){
console.log(`Hello ${student.name}`);
if(student.course){
console.log(`Welcome to the ${student.course}` semester`);
}
}

const newStudent: IStudent = { name: 'Heitor', university: 'UDF' };

greetingStudent(newStudent);

As you can see, we have a new property called course that has a ? declared on it.
This symbolizes that this property can be nulled or undefined. It's called an
optional property.

There is a property with a read-only attribute declared. If we try to change after it's
declared on the variable creation, we will receive a compile error because it makes
the property read-only.

Decorators

A new feature was introduced in ECMAScript 6—classes. With the introduction
of these, the usage of decorators was made possible on the JavaScript engine.

Decorators provide a way to add both annotations and meta-programming syntax
to class declarations and its members. As it's in a final state of approval on the TC-
39 committee (where TC stands for Technical Committee), the TypeScript
compiler already has this available to be used.

To enable it, you can set the flags on the tsconfig.json file:

{
"compilerOptions": {
"target": "ES5",
"experimentalDecorators": true
}
}

Decorators are a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class,
method, accessor property, or parameter. They are used in the form of @expression,
where the expression is a function that will be called at runtime.





An example of a decorator that can be applied to a class can be seen in the
following code snippet:

function classSeal(constructor: Function) {
Object.seal(constructor);
Object.seal(constructor.prototype);
}

When you create this function, you are saying that the object of the constructor
and the prototype of it will be sealed.

To use it inside a class is very simple:

@classSeal
class Animal {
sound: string;
constructor(sound: string) {
this.sound = sound;
}
emitSound() {
return "The animal says, " + this.sound;
}
}

These are just some examples of decorators and their powers to help you with the
development of object-oriented programming (OOP) with TypeScript.

In conclusion

In summary, types are just a way to make our life easier in the process of
development with TypeScript and JavaScript.

Because JavaScript is a dynamic language and doesn't have a static type, all the
types and interfaces declared in TypeScript are strictly used just by TypeScript.
This helps the compiler catch errors, warnings, and the language server to help the
integrated development environment (IDE) on the development process to
analyze your code as it is being written.

This is a basic introduction to TypeScript, covering the basics of the typed
language, and how to understand and use it. There is much more to learn about its
use, such as generics, modules, namespaces, and so on.

With this introduction, you can understand how the new Vue 3 core works and
how to use the basics of TypeScript in your project, and take advantage of the
typed language on your project.


There is always more knowledge to find on TypeScript, as it is a growing
"language" on top of JavaScript and has a growing community.

Don't forget to look at the TypeScript documentation to find out more about it and
how it can improve your code from now on.

Creating your first TypeScript class

In TypeScript, there is no main paradigm in which you write your program. You
can choose between object-oriented, structural, or event functional.

In most cases, you will see an OOP paradigm being used. In this recipe, we will
learn about creating a class inside TypeScript, its inheritance, the interface, and
other properties that can be used inside the code.

Getting ready


To start our project, we will need to create an npm project. To do this,
open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows)
and execute the following command:

> npm init -y

You also need to install TypeScript. To do this, open Terminal (macOS or Linux)
or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm install typescript --only=dev

How to do it...

When writing a class inside a TypeScript file, we first need to have in mind what
this class will do, what this class can be for, how it can be extended by another
class through inheritance, and how it can be affected in the process.

Imagine that we have a basic Animal class. This class can have some basic
properties such as its name, whether it produces a sound, its family, and the basic food
chain this animal eats.

1. Let's start with the basics of the process, the food chain. We need to make sure
that it's an innumerable list, and that each file that is using it will have the
same value at the end. We just need to call a constant variable:

export enum FoodChainType {
Carnivorous = 'carnivorous',
Herbivorous = 'herbivorous',
Omnivorous = 'omnivorous',
}

2. Now, we want to make the basic interface for our animal. We know that our
animal has a name, can produce a sound, can be part of a family, and be in a food
chain category. Using an interface in a class, we make a contract between the
class and what will be exposed, helping in the development process:

interface IAnimal {
name: string;
sound?: string;
family: string;
foodChainType: FoodChainType;
}

3. With all that settled, we can make our Animal class. Each class can have its
constructor. The class constructor can be simple, containing just some


variables as arguments, or can be more complex and have an object as an
argument. If your constructor will have any parameters, an interface or
declaring the type of each parameter is needed. In this case, our constructor
will be an object and will have only one parameter that is the same as the
Animal, so it will extend the IAnimal interface:

interface IAnimalConstructor extends IAnimal {
}

4. Now, to make our class, we have declared the interfaces and enums that will

be used. We will start by declaring that the class will implement
the IBasicAnimal interface. To do this, we need to add some public elements
that our class will have and declare those too. We will need to implement the
functions to show what animal it is and what sound it makes. Now, we have a
basic class that includes all the attributes for our animal. It has separate
interfaces for the class and the constructors. The enum for the food chain is
declared in a human-readable way, so the JavaScript imports of this library
can execute without any problems:

interface IBasicAnimal extends IAnimal {
whoAmI: () => void;
makeSound: () => void;
}

export class Animal implements IBasicAnimal {
public name: string;
public sound: string;
public family: string;
public foodChainType: FoodChainType;

constructor(params: IAnimalConstructor) {
this.name = params.name;
this.sound = params.sound || '';
this.family = params.family;
this.foodChainType = params.foodChainType;
}

public whoAmI(): void {
console.log(`I am a ${this.name}, my family is ${this.family}.
My diet is ${this.foodChainType}.`);
if (this.sound) {
console.log([...Array(2).fill(this.sound)].join(', '));
}
}

public makeSound(): void {
console.log(this.sound);
}
}

5. Let's extend this class with a few lines of code and transform this Animal into a

Dog:






import {Animal, FoodChainType} from './Animal';

class Dog extends Animal {
constructor() {
super({
name: 'Dog',
sound: 'Wof!',
family: 'Canidae',
foodChainType: FoodChainType.Carnivorous,
});
}n
}

This is a simple way of extending a parent class and using the parent's definition
of the child to compose a new class with almost the same interface as the parent.

How it works...

Classes in TypeScript work the same as other classes in languages such as Java or
C#. The compiler evaluates these common principles during development and
compilation.

In this case, we made a simple class that had some public properties that were
inherent by the children's classes. These variables were all readable and can be
mutated.

There's more...

In TypeScript, we have a wide range of possible uses for classes, such as abstract
classes, special modifiers, and using classes as interfaces. We've just covered the
basics of the classes here to give us a good starting knowledge base. If you want to
go deeper, the TypeScript documentation is very helpful and has a lot of examples
that can help in the process of learning.

Creating your first project with Vue
CLI

When the Vue team realized that developers were having problems creating and
managing their applications, they saw an opportunity to create a tool that could
help developers around the world. The Vue CLI project was born.

The Vue CLI tool is a CLI tool that is used in terminal commands, such as
Windows PowerShell, Linux Bash, or macOS Terminal. It was created as a
starting point for the development of Vue, where developers can start a project and
manage and build it smoothly. The focus of the Vue CLI team when developing
was to give developers the opportunity to have more time to think about the code
and spend less time on the tooling needed to put their code into production, adding
new plugins or a simple hot-module-reload.

The Vue CLI tool is tweaked in such a way that there is no need to eject your
tooling code outside the CLI before putting it into production.

When version 3 was released, the Vue UI project was added to the CLI as the main
function, transforming the CLI commands into a more complete visual solution
with lots of new additions and improvements.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To create a Vue CLI project, follow these steps:


1. We need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create my-first-project

2. The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the

project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue,
and the Spacebar to select an option:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
default (babel, eslint)
❯ Manually select features

3. There are two methods for starting a new project. The default method is a
basic babel and eslint project without any plugin or configuration, and the
Manually mode, where you can select more modes, plugins, linters, and
options. We will go for Manually.

4. Now, we are asked about the features that we will want on the project. Those
features are some Vue plugins such as Vuex or Router (Vue-Router), testers,
linters, and more:

? Check the features needed for your project: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Babel
TypeScript
Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
Router
Vuex
CSS Pre-processors
❯ Linter / Formatter
Unit Testing
❯ E2E Testing

5. For this project, we will choose  CSS Pre-processors and press Enter to continue:

? Check the features needed for your project: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Babel
TypeScript
Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
Router
Vuex
❯ CSS Pre-processors
❯ Linter / Formatter
Unit Testing
E2E Testing

6. It's possible to choose the main Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) preprocessors
to be used with Vue—Sass, Less, and Stylus. It's up to you to choose which fits
the most and is best for you:

? Pick a CSS pre-processor (PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CSS Modules
are supported by default): (Use arrow keys)
Sass/SCSS (with dart-sass)


Sass/SCSS (with node-sass)
Less
❯ Stylus

7. It's time to format your code. You can choose between AirBnB, Standard, and

Prettier with a basic config. Those rules that are imported inside the ESLint can
be always customized without any problem and there is a perfect one for your
needs. You know what is best for you:

? Pick a linter / formatter config: (Use arrow keys)
ESLint with error prevention only
❯ ESLint + Airbnb config
ESLint + Standard config
ESLint + Prettier

8. After the linting rules are set, we need to define when they are applied to

your code. They can be either applied on save or fixed on commit:

? Pick additional lint features: (Use arrow keys)
Lint on save
❯ Lint and fix on commit

9. After all those plugins, linters, and processors are defined, we need to choose
where the settings and configs are stored. The best place to store them is on a
dedicated file, but it is also possible to store then on the package.json file:

? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? (Use arrow keys)
❯ In dedicated config files
In package.json

10. Now, you can choose if you want to make this selection a preset for future

projects so that you don't need to reselect everything again:

? Save this as a preset for future projects? (y/N) n

11. The CLI will automatically create the folder with the name you set in the first

step, install everything, and configure the project.

You are now able to navigate and run the project. The basic commands on Vue
CLI projects are as follows:

npm run serve—For running a development server locally
npm run build—For building and minifying the application for deployment
npm run lint—To execute the lint on the code

You can execute those commands via the Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows).


There's more...

The CLI has a tool inside it called Vue UI that helps in the process of managing
your Vue projects. This tool will take care of the project dependencies, plugins,
and configurations.

Each npm script in the Vue UI tool is named as Tasks, and on those tasks, you can
get real-time statistics such as—for example—the size of the assets, modules, and
dependencies; numbers of errors or warnings; and more deep networking data for
fine-tuning your application.

To enter the Vue UI interface, you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue ui

Adding plugins to a Vue CLI project
with Vue UI

The Vue UI tool is one of the most powerful additional tools for Vue development.
It makes a developer's life easier, and at the same time can help manage the Vue
projects.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:


@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

First, we need to create our Vue CLI project. To find how to create a Vue CLI
project, please check the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe. We can
use the one we created in the last recipe or start a new one. Now, follow the
instructions to add a plugin:

1. Open the Vue UI interface. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue ui

2. A new browser window will appear, with the Vue UI interface:

Here, you can list your projects, create a new project, or import an existing
one.

3. Now, we will import the one we created:


You need to find the folder that you created and click on Import this folder.

4. After the folder is imported, the default Dashboard of the project will appear:


Here, it's possible to customize your Dashboard, adding new widgets, by clic
on the Customize button on the top:


5. To add a new plugin, you must click on the Plugins menu in the left-hand

sidebar:

The base plugins that you added on the Vue CLI tool will be already listed
here.

6. Now, we will add the base Vue ecosystem plugins—vuex and vue-router:


7. If you check your code, you will see that the main.js file was changed, and the
vuex (store) and vue-router (router) plugins are now imported and injected to
the Vue instance:


How it works...

The Vue UI plugins work in conjunction with npm or yarn to automatically install
the packages on your project, and then inject—when possible—the necessary
conditions on the Vue instance.

If a plugin is a visual, directive, or a non-direct instantiated plugin, the Vue UI will
install it and manage it, but you need to import it for use on your application.

Adding TypeScript to a Vue CLI
project

Using TypeScript in a JavaScript project, even for static type checking, is good
practice. It helps minimize the chance of errors and Object problems inside your
project.

Adding TypeScript to a Vue project with the help of the Vue UI is very simple,
and you will be able to use JavaScript code with TypeScript.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

First, we need to create our Vue CLI project. To find how to create a Vue CLI
project, please check the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe. We can
use the one we created in the last recipe or start a new one.


To add TypeScript to a Vue CLI project, follow these steps:

1. Open the Vue UI interface. Open the Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> vue ui

2. On your project, go to the Plugins manager, click on + Add plugin, and

search for @vue/cli-plugin-typescript:

3. Now, click on the Install @vue/cli-plugin-typescript button at the bottom of

the page:


4. You will be asked for some configuration settings after the plugin is

downloaded, before the final installation:

Use class-style component syntax? Use the vue-class-component plugin
with TypeScript.
Use Babel alongside TypeScript (required for modern mode, auto-
detected polyfills, transpiling JSX)? Activate Babel to transpile
TypeScript in addition to the TypeScript compiler.
Use ESLint? Use ESLint as a linter for the .ts and .tsx files.
Convert all .js files to .ts? Automatically convert all your .js files to .ts
files in the installation process.
Allow .js files to be compiled? Activate the tsconfig.json flag to accept
.js files in the compiler.

5. After choosing your options, click on Finish the installation.
6. Now, your project is a TypeScript Vue project, with all the files configured

and ready to be coded:


How it works...

The Vue UI as a plugin manager will download the TypeScript package made for
Vue, and install and configure it for you with the settings you choose.

Your project will be changed and modified according to your specifications, and
will then be ready for development.

Creating your first TypeScript Vue
component with vue-class-component

As Vue components are object-based and have a strong relationship with the this
keyword of the JavaScript object, it gets a little bit confusing to develop a
TypeScript component.

The vue-class-component plugin uses the ECMAScript decorators proposal to pass the
statically typed values directly to the Vue component and makes the process of the
compiler understand what is happening more easily.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli


@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

First, we need to create our Vue CLI project. We can use the one we created in the
last recipe or start a new one. To find how to create a Vue CLI project with
TypeScript, please check the 'Adding TypeScript to a Vue CLI project' recipe.

Follow the instructions to create your first Vue component with Typescript and
vue-class-component:

1. Create a new file inside the src/components folder, called Counter.vue.
2. Now, let's start making the script part of the Vue component. We will make a
class that will have data with a number, two methods—one for increasing and
another for decreasing—and, finally, a computed property to format the final
data:

<script lang="ts">
import Vue from 'vue';
import Component from 'vue-class-component';

@Component
export default class Counter extends Vue {
valueNumber: number = 0;

get formattedNumber() {
return `Your total number is: ${this.valueNumber}`;
}

increase() {
this.valueNumber += 1;
}

decrease() {
this.valueNumber -= 1;
}
}
</script>

3. It's time to create the template and rendering for this component. The process
is the same as a JavaScript Vue file. We will add the buttons for increasing
and decreasing the value and showing the formatted text:

<template>
<div>
<fieldset>
<legend>{{ formattedNumber }}</legend>
<button @click="increase">Increase</button>
<button @click="decrease">Decrease</button>
</fieldset>
</div>
</template>






4. In the App.vue file, we need to import the component we just created:

<template>
<div id="app">
<Counter />
</div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { Component, Vue } from 'vue-property-decorator';
import Counter from './components/Counter.vue';

@Component({
components: {
Counter,
},
})
export default class App extends Vue {

}
</script>
<style lang="stylus">
#app
font-family 'Avenir', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
-webkit-font-smoothing antialiased
-moz-osx-font-smoothing grayscale
text-align center
color #2c3e50
margin-top 60px
</style>

5. Now, when you run the npm run serve command on Terminal (macOS or Linux)
or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows), you will see your component
running and executing on screen:

How it works...

The vue-class-component plugin makes use of the new proposal of decorators to inject
and pass some attributes to the classes on TypeScript.

This injection helps in the process of simplifying the development of a component
with a syntax more aligned with TypeScript than with the Vue common object.

Creating a custom mixin with vue-
class-component

In Vue, a mixin is a way to reuse the same code in other Vue objects, like mixing all
the property of the mixin inside the component.

When using a mixin, Vue first declares the mixin property and then the component
values, so the components will be always the last and valid values. This merge
occurs in a deep mode and has a specific way already declared inside the
framework, but it can be changed by a special config.

With the use of mixins, developers can write tiny pieces of code and reuse them in
lots of components.

This approach simplifies your work and allows you to complete tasks quicker.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

First, we need to create our Vue CLI project. We can use the one we created in the
last recipe or start a new one. To find how to create a Vue CLI project with


TypeScript, please check the 'Creating your first TypeScript Vue component with
vue-class-component' recipe.

In this recipe, we will split it into two separate parts. First, we will create the
counter component, and then we will use the code that is shared to create the
mixin.

Creating the Counter component

Now, follow the instructions to create a custom mixin with vue-class-component:

1. We need to make a new component called CounterByTen.vue in the src/components

folder.

2. Now, let's start making the script part of the Vue component. We will make a
class that will have a variable with the type of a number and a default value
of 0; two methods, one for increasing by 10 and another for decreasing by 10;
and, finally, a computed property to format the final data:

<script lang="ts">
import Vue from 'vue';
import Component from 'vue-class-component';

@Component
export default class CounterByTen extends Vue {
valueNumber: number = 0;

get formattedNumber() {
return `Your total number is: ${this.valueNumber}`;
}

increase() {
this.valueNumber += 10;
}

decrease() {
this.valueNumber -= 10;
}
}
</script>

3. It's time to create the template and rendering for this component. The process

is the same as for a JavaScript Vue file. We will add the buttons for
increasing and decreasing the value and for showing the formatted text:

<template>
<div>
<fieldset>
<legend>{{ this.formattedNumber }}</legend>
<button @click="increase">Increase By Ten</button>
<button @click="decrease">Decrease By Ten</button>
</fieldset>






</div>
</template>

4. In the App.vue file, we need to import the component we just created:

<template>
<div id="app">
<Counter />
<hr />
<CounterByTen />
</div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { Component, Vue } from 'vue-property-decorator';
import Counter from './components/Counter.vue';
import CounterByTen from './components/CounterByTen.vue';

@Component({
components: {
Counter,
CounterByTen,
},
})
export default class App extends Vue {

}
</script>
<style lang="stylus">
#app
font-family 'Avenir', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
-webkit-font-smoothing antialiased
-moz-osx-font-smoothing grayscale
text-align center
color #2c3e50
margin-top 60px
</style>

Extracting similar code for the mixin

With both of the components having similar code, we can extract this similar code
and create a mixin. This mixin can be imported in both of the components and
their behavior will be the same:

1. Create a file called defaultNumber.ts in the src/mixins folder.
2. To code our mixin, we will import the Component and Vue decorators from the
vue-class-component plugin, to be the base of the mixin. We will need to take a
similar code and place it inside the mixin:

import Vue from 'vue';
import Component from 'vue-class-component';

@Component
export default class DefaultNumber extends Vue {
valueNumber: number = 0;

get formattedNumber() {







return `Your total number is: ${this.valueNumber}`;
}
}

3. With the mixin ready, open the Counter.vue component on the src/components

folder and import it. To do this, we need to import a special export from the
vue-class-component called mixins and extend it with the mixin we want to
extend. This will remove the Vue and Component decorators because they
are already declared on the mixin:

<template>
<div>
<fieldset>
<legend>{{ this.formattedNumber }}</legend>
<button @click="increase">Increase By Ten</button>
<button @click="decrease">Decrease By Ten</button>
</fieldset>
</div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import Vue from 'vue';
import Component, { mixins } from 'vue-class-component';
import DefaultNumber from '../mixins/defaultNumber';

@Component
export default class CounterByTen extends mixins(DefaultNumber) {
increase() {
this.valueNumber += 10;
}

decrease() {
this.valueNumber -= 10;
}
}
</script>

4. Now, when you run the npm run serve command on Terminal (macOS or Linux)
or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows), you will see your component

How it works...

The process of using mixins with TypeScript is the same as with the Vue objects.
The code that is shared can be split into smaller files and called in the components
for easier coding.

When using TypeScript and vue-class-component, the Vue and Component decorators need
to be declared on the mixins because the class that will be using the mixin will
already have this extension, as it extends this mixin.

We took the same piece of code that works the same on both the components and
placed it in a new file that is then called in both of the components.

Creating a custom function decorator
with vue-class-component


Decorators were introduced in ECMAScript 2015. A decorator is a kind of high-
order function that wraps a function with another function.

This brings a lot of new improvements to the code—along with greater
productivity—because it takes the principle of functional programming and
simplifies it.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

First, we need to create our Vue CLI project. To find how to create a Vue CLI
project, please check the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe. We can
use the one we created in the last recipe or start a new one.

Follow these steps to create your custom function decorator with vue-class-
component:

1. Create a file called componentMount.js inside the src/decorators folder.
2. We need to import the createDecorator function from the vue-class-component to be
able to use it on a vue-class-component based component, and to start coding our
decorator:

import { createDecorator } from 'vue-class-component';
import componentMountLogger from './componentLogger';

export default createDecorator((options) => {
options.mixins = [...options.mixins, componentMountLogger];
});

A createDecorator function is like an extension of the Vue vm (View-Model), so it won't have the
property of an ECMAScript decorator but will function as a Vue decorator.



3. We need to use the componentLogger.js file in our decorator. This function will

take all the data values that are set in the "decorated" component and add a
watcher to it. This watcher will log the new and old values whenever it
changes. This function will only be executed with a debug data set to true:

export default {
mounted() {
if (this.debug) {
const componentName = this.name || '';
console.log(`The ${componentName} was mounted
successfully.`);

const dataKeys = Object.keys(this.$data);

if (dataKeys.length) {
console.log('The base data are:');
console.table(dataKeys);

dataKeys.forEach((key) => {
this.$watch(key, (newValue, oldValue) => {
console.log(`The new value for ${key} is:
${newValue}`);
console.log(`The old value for ${key} is:
${oldValue}`);
}, {
deep: true,
});
});
}
}
},
};

4. Now, we need to import the decorator to our Counter.vue component file

located in the src/components folder and add the debugger data to it:

<template>
<div>
<fieldset>
<legend>{{ this.formattedNumber }}</legend>
<button @click="increase">Increase</button>
<button@click="decrease">Decrease</button>
</fieldset>
</div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import Vue from 'vue';
import Component from 'vue-class-component';
import componentMount from '../decorators/componentMount';

@Component
@componentMount
export default class Counter extends Vue {
valueNumber: number = 0;

debug: boolean = true;

get formattedNumber() {
return `Your total number is: ${this.valueNumber}`;
}









increase() {
this.valueNumber += 1;
}

decrease() {
this.valueNumber -= 1;
}
}
</script>

How it works...

The createDecorator function is a factory function that extends the Vue vm (View
Model), which produces an extension of the Vue component, such as a Vue mixin.
A Vue mixin is a property of the Vue component that can be used to share and
reuse code between components.

When we call the mixin, it takes the current component as an option of the first
argument (the key if it was attached to a property), and the index of it.

We added a dynamic debugger that is only attached when debug data exists and is
set to true. This debugger will log the current data and set watchers for the changes
in the data, showing the logs on the console each time the data is changed.

There's more...

When using linters, some rules can be a problem with decorators. So, it's wise to
disable them only on the files that are having problems with the rules that are
required for the code to work.

In an AirBnB style, for example, the no-param-reassign rule is required because the
decorator uses the option as a reference to pass the value.

Adding custom hooks to vue-class-
component

On Vue, it's possible to add hooks to its life cycle through the Plugins application
programming interface (API). The most basic example is the vue-router with the
navigation guards, such as the beforeRouterEnter and beforeRouterLeave functions
hooks.

The hooks, as the name implies, are little functions that are called each time
something will happen.

You can take advantage of the hooks and make them more powerful, adding new
functionalities to your components, such as checking for special security access,
adding meta search engine optimization (SEO), or even pre-fetching data.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

First, we need to create our Vue CLI project. We can use the one we created in the
last recipe or start a new one. To find how to create a Vue CLI project with
TypeScript, please check the 'Adding TypeScript to a Vue CLI project' recipe.

Now, follow these steps to add custom hooks to your Vue project using TypeScript
and vue-class-component:

1. We need to add vue-router to the project. This can be done with the Vue CLI
project creation or in the Vue UI interface after the project has been created.


If prompted about the mode, the vue-router should run. Take note that selecting
the History option will require special server configuration when it's time to deploy.

2. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the npm run serve command, and
you will see that the vue-router is working and that there are two working
routers: home and about.

3. Let's start creating and naming our hooks to register on the main application.

To do this, we need to create a vue-router.js file inside the
src/classComponentsHooks folder:

import Component from 'vue-class-component';

Component.registerHooks([
'beforeRouteEnter',
'beforeRouteLeave',
]);

4. We need to import this file to the main.ts file as it needs to be called before the

application final build:

import './classComponentsHooks/vue-router';

import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import router from './router';

Vue.config.productionTip = false;

new Vue({
router,
render: h => h(App),
}).$mount('#app');

5. We now have the hooks registered on the vue-class-component and they can be

used inside the TypeScript components.

6. We need to create a new router location called Secure.vue in the src/views folder.
The secure page will have a password to enter, vuejs. When the user enters
this password, the router guard will grant permission, and the user can see the
page. If the password is wrong, the user will be taken back to the home page.
When they leave the page, an alert will show a message to the user:

<template>
<div class="secure">
<h1>This is an secure page</h1>
</div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { Component, Vue } from 'vue-property-decorator';







import { Route, RawLocation } from 'vue-router';

type RouteNext = (to?: RawLocation | false | ((vm: Vue) => any) |
void) => void;

@Component
export default class Home extends Vue {
beforeRouteEnter(to: Route, from: Route, next: RouteNext) {
const securePassword = 'vuejs';

const userPassword = prompt('What is the password?');

if (userPassword === securePassword) {
next();
} else if (!userPassword) {
next('/');
}
}

beforeRouteLeave(to: Route, from: Route, next: RouteNext) {
alert('Bye!');
next();
}
}
</script>

7. Now with our page done, we need to add it to the router.ts file to be able to

call it in the Vue application:

import Vue from 'vue';
import Router from 'vue-router';
import Home from './views/Home.vue';

Vue.use(Router);

export default new Router({
routes: [
{
path: '/',
name: 'home',
component: Home,
},
{
path: '/about',
name: 'about',
component: () => import('./views/About.vue'),
},
{
path: '/secure',
name: 'secure',
component: () => import('./views/Secure.vue'),
},
],
});

8. With the route added and the view created, the final step is to add the link to
the main App.vue file, and we will have a component with an integrated hook
on it:

<template>
<div id="app">
<div id="nav">









<router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |
<router-link to="/about">About</router-link> |
<router-link to="/secure">Secure</router-link>
</div>
<router-view/>
</div>
</template>
<style lang="stylus">
#app
font-family 'Avenir', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
-webkit-font-smoothing antialiased
-moz-osx-font-smoothing grayscale
text-align center
color #2c3e50

#nav
padding 30px
a
font-weight bold
color #2c3e50
&.router-link-exact-active
color #42b983
</style>

How it works...

The class component needs to understand what are the navigation guards that are
being added to the Vue prototype before executing the Vue application. Because of
this, we needed to import the custom hooks on the first line of the main.ts file.

In the component, with the hooks registered, it's possible to add them as methods
because the vue-class-component has made all those custom imports into base
methods for the component decorator.

We used two of the vue-router navigation guards' hooks. Those hooks are called
each time a route will enter or leave. The first two parameters we didn't use, the to
and from parameters, are the ones that carry information about the future route and
the past route.

The next function is always required because it executes a route change. If no
argument is passed in the function, the route will continue with the one that was
called, but if you want to change the route on the fly, it is possible to pass an
argument to change where the user will go.

Adding vue-property-decorator to
vue-class-component

Some of the most important parts of Vue are missing in the vue-class-component in
the form of TypeScript decorators. So, the community made a library called vue-
property-decorator that is fully endorsed by the Vue core team.

This library brings some of the missing parts as ECMAScript proposal decorators,
such as props, watch, model, inject, and so on.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

First, we need to create our Vue CLI project. We can use the one we created in the
last recipe or start a new one. To find how to create a Vue CLI project with
TypeScript, please check the 'Creating a custom mixin with vue-class-component'
recipe.

Follow these steps to add vue-property-decorator to a Vue class-based component:

1. We need to add the vue-property-decorator to our project.

Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:


> npm install -S vue-property-decorator

2. In the components mixin, we will add a decorator for receiving a prop, which

will be a value for our number that is calculated:

import {
Vue,
Component,
Prop,
} from 'vue-property-decorator';

@Component
export default class DefaultNumber extends Vue {
valueNumber: number = 0;

@Prop(Number) readonly value: number | undefined;

get formattedNumber() {
return `Your total number is: ${this.valueNumber}`;
}
}

3. With that number, we need to make the watchers emit the event to the parent
component when the value changes, and update the value inside when the
value is changed within the parent component. To do this, we need to create a
new file called numberWatcher.ts inside the src/mixins folder:

import {
Watch,
Mixins,
} from 'vue-property-decorator';
import DefaultNumber from './defaultNumber';

export default class NumberWatchers extends Mixins(DefaultNumber) {
@Watch('valueNumber')
onValueNumberChanged(val: number) {
this.$emit('input', val);
}

@Watch('value', { immediate: true })
onValueChanged(val: number) {
this.valueNumber = val;
}
}

In Vue, the v-model directive works like a sugar syntax, as a combination of the Vue $emit function
and the Vue props function. When the value is changed, the component needs to $emit with the
'input' name, and the component needs to have in the props function a value key, which will be the
value that will be passed down from the parent component to the child component.

4. With our mixin updated, our components need to be updated too. First, we

will update the Counter.vue component, changing the imported mixin from the
defaultNumber.ts file to numberWatcher.ts:

<template>
<div>
<fieldset>







<legend>{{ this.formattedNumber }}</legend>
<button @click="increase">Increase</button>
<button @click="decrease">Decrease</button>
</fieldset>
</div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import Vue from 'vue';
import Component, { mixins } from 'vue-class-component';
import NumberWatcher from '../mixins/numberWatcher';

@Component
export default class Counter extends mixins(NumberWatcher) {
increase() {
this.valueNumber += 1;
}

decrease() {
this.valueNumber -= 1;
}
}
</script>

5. Now, we will update the CounterByTen.vue component, and add the newly

created mixin:

<template>
<div>
<fieldset>
<legend>{{ this.formattedNumber }}</legend>
<button @click="increase">Increase By Ten</button>
<button @click="decrease">Decrease By Ten</button>
</fieldset>
</div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import Vue from 'vue';
import Component, { mixins } from 'vue-class-component';
import NumberWatcher from '../mixins/numberWatcher';

@Component
export default class CounterByTen extends mixins(NumberWatcher) {
increase() {
this.valueNumber += 10;
}

decrease() {
this.valueNumber -= 10;
}
}
</script>

6. With everything settled, we just need to update the App.vue component. This
time, we will store a variable in the component that will be passed down to
both of the child components, and when the components emit the update
events, this variable will change automatically, updating the other
components too:








<template>
<div id="app">
<Counter
v-model="amount"
/>
<hr />
<CounterByTen
v-model="amount"
/>
</div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { Component, Vue } from 'vue-property-decorator';
import Counter from './components/Counter.vue';
import CounterByTen from './components/CounterByTen.vue';

@Component({
components: {
Counter,
CounterByTen,
},
})
export default class App extends Vue {
amount: number = 0;
}
</script>
<style lang="stylus">
#app
font-family 'Avenir', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
-webkit-font-smoothing antialiased
-moz-osx-font-smoothing grayscale
text-align center
color #2c3e50
margin-top 60px
</style>

How it works...

By injecting the decorators at the vue-class-components, the vue-property-decorator helps
the TypeScript compiler check for the types and static analysis of your Vue code.

We used two of the decorators available, the @Watch and @Prop decorators.

As we took apart the common parts of our code in the form of mixins, the process
implementation became easier.

The parent component passed down a property to the child component, passing the
initial value and the subsequently updated value.

This value is checked and updated inside the child component, which is used to
update a local variable used by the calculation functions. When the calculation is
done and the value is changed, the watcher emits an event that is passed to the
parent component, which updates the main variable, and the loop goes on.




There's more...

There is another library that works the same as the vue-property-decorator, but for the
vuex plugin, called vuex-class.

This library uses the same process as vue-property-decorator. It creates an inject
decorator in the component. Those decorators help the TypeScript compiler to
check for types in the development process.

You can find more information about this library at https://github.com/ktsn/vuex-clas

Data Binding, Form Validations, Events,
and Computed Properties

Data is the most valuable asset in the world right now, and knowing how to
manage it is a must. In Vue, we have the power to choose how we can gather this
data, manipulate it as we want, and deliver it to the server.

In this chapter, we will learn more about the process of data manipulation and data
handling, form validations, data filtering, how to display this data to the user, and
how to present it in a way that is different from what we then have inside our
application.

We will learn how to use the vue-devtools to go deep inside the Vue components and
see what is happening to our data and application.

In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:

Creating the "hello world" component
Creating an input form with two-way data binding
Adding an event listener to an element
Removing the v-model from the input
Creating a dynamic to-do list
Creating computed properties and exploring how they work
Displaying cleaner data and text with custom filters
Adding form validation with Vuelidate
Creating filters and sorters for a list
Creating conditional filtering to sort list data
Adding custom styles and transitions
Using vue-devtools to debug your application

Technical requirements

In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue CLI.

Attention, Windows users—you need to install an npm package called windows-build-tools to be
able to install the following required packages. To do this, open PowerShell as
administrator and execute the following command:
> npm install -g windows-build-tools.


To install Vue CLI, you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global

Creating the "hello world" component

A Vue application is a combination of various components, bound together and
orchestrated by the Vue framework. Knowing how to make your component is
important. Each component is like a brick in the wall and needs to be made in a
way that, when placed, doesn't end up needing other bricks to be reshaped in
different ways around it. We are going to learn how to make a base component,
with some important principles that focus on organization and clean code.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue CLI as learned in
the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing
TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or start a new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create my-component

The command-line interface (CLI) will ask some questions that will help with
the creation of the project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key
to continue, and the spacebar to select an option. Choose the default option:


? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
❯ default (babel, eslint)
Manually select features

Let's create our first "hello world" component, following these steps:

1. Let's create a new file called CurrentTime.vue file in the src/components folder.
2. On this file, we will start with the <template> part of our component. It will be

a shadowed-box card that will display the current date formatted:

<template>
<div class='cardBox'>
<div class='container'>
<h2>Today is:</h2>
<h3>{{ getCurrentDate }}</h3>
</div>
</div>
</template>

3. Now, we need to create the <script> part. We will start with the name property.

This will be used when debugging our application with vue-devtools to identify
our component and helps the integrated development environment (IDE)
too. For the getCurrentDate computed property, we will create a computed
property that will return the current date, formatted by the Intl browser
function:

<script>
export default {
name: 'CurrentTime',
computed: {
getCurrentDate() {
const browserLocale =
navigator.languages && navigator.languages.length
? navigator.languages[0]
: navigator.language;
const intlDateTime = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(
browserLocale,
{
year: 'numeric',
month: 'numeric',
day: 'numeric',
hour: 'numeric',
minute: 'numeric'
});

return intlDateTime.format(new Date());
}
}
};
</script>

4. For styling our box, we need to create a style.css file in the src folder, then

add the cardBox style to it:

.cardBox {
box-shadow: 0 5px 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);



transition: 0.3s linear;
max-width: 33%;
border-radius: 3px;
margin: 20px;
}

.cardBox:hover {
box-shadow: 0 10px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

.cardBox>.container {
padding: 4px 18px;
}

[class*='col-'] {
display: inline-block;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
[class*='col-'] {
width: 100%;
}

.cardBox {
margin: 20px 0;
}
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
.col-1 {width: 8.33%;}
.col-2 {width: 16.66%;}
.col-3 {width: 25%;}
.col-4 {width: 33.33%;}
.col-5 {width: 41.66%;}
.col-6 {width: 50%;}
.col-7 {width: 58.33%;}
.col-8 {width: 66.66%;}
.col-9 {width: 75%;}
.col-10 {width: 83.33%;}
.col-11 {width: 91.66%;}
.col-12 {width: 100%;}
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
.col-1 {width: 8.33%;}
.col-2 {width: 16.66%;}
.col-3 {width: 25%;}
.col-4 {width: 33.33%;}
.col-5 {width: 41.66%;}
.col-6 {width: 50%;}
.col-7 {width: 58.33%;}
.col-8 {width: 66.66%;}
.col-9 {width: 75%;}
.col-10 {width: 83.33%;}
.col-11 {width: 91.66%;}
.col-12 {width: 100%;}
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {
.col-1 {width: 8.33%;}
.col-2 {width: 16.66%;}
.col-3 {width: 25%;}
.col-4 {width: 33.33%;}
.col-5 {width: 41.66%;}
.col-6 {width: 50%;}
.col-7 {width: 58.33%;}










.col-8 {width: 66.66%;}
.col-9 {width: 75%;}
.col-10 {width: 83.33%;}
.col-11 {width: 91.66%;}
.col-12 {width: 100%;}
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
.col-1 {width: 8.33%;}
.col-2 {width: 16.66%;}
.col-3 {width: 25%;}
.col-4 {width: 33.33%;}
.col-5 {width: 41.66%;}
.col-6 {width: 50%;}
.col-7 {width: 58.33%;}
.col-8 {width: 66.66%;}
.col-9 {width: 75%;}
.col-10 {width: 83.33%;}
.col-11 {width: 91.66%;}
.col-12 {width: 100%;}
}

5. In the App.vue file, we need to import our component to be able to see it:

<template>
<div id='app'>
<current-time />
</div>
</template>

<script>
import CurrentTime from './components/CurrentTime.vue';

export default {
name: 'app',
components: {
CurrentTime
}
}
</script>

6. In the main.js file, we need to import the style.css file to be included in the

Vue application:

import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import './style.css';

Vue.config.productionTip = false

new Vue({
render: h => h(App),
}).$mount('#app')

7. To run the server and see your component, you need to

open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve







Here is your component rendered and running:

How it works...

The Vue component works almost like the Node.js packages. To use it in your
code, you need to import the component and then declare it inside the components
property on the component you want to use.

Like a wall of bricks, a Vue application is made of components that call and use
other components.

For our component, we used the Intl.DateTimeFormat function, a native function,
which can be used to format and parse dates to declared locations. To get the local
format, we used the navigator global variable.

See also

You can find more information about Intl.DateTimeFormat at https://developer.mozilla.o
rg/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat.

You can find more information about Vue components at https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/s

ingle-file-component.html

Creating an input form with two-way
data binding

To gather data on the web, we use HTML form inputs. In Vue, it's possible to use
a two-way data binding method, where the value of the input on the Document
Object Model (DOM) is passed to the JavaScript—or vice versa.


This makes the web form more dynamic, giving you the possibility to manage,
format, and validate the data before saving or sending the data back to the server.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in
the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing
TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Creating the "hello
world" component' recipe.

Now, let's follow these steps to create an input form with a two-way data binding:

1. Let's create a new file called TaskInput.vue in the src/components folder.
2. In this file, we're going to create a component that will have a text input and a
display text. This text will be based on what is typed on the text input. At the
<template> part of the component, we need to create an HTML input and a
mustache variable that will receive and render the data:

<template>
<div class='cardBox'>
<div class='container tasker'>
<strong>My task is: {{ task }}</strong>
<input
type='text'
v-model='task'
class='taskInput' />
</div>
</div>
</template>

3. Now, on the <script> part of the component, we will name it and add the task
to the data property. As the data always needs to be a returned Object, we will
use an arrow function to return an Object directly:


<script>
export default {
name: 'TaskInput',
data: () => ({
task: '',
}),
};
</script>

4. We need to add some style to this component. In the <style> part of the

component, we need to add the scoped attribute so that the style remains only
bound to the component and won't mix with other Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS) rules:

<style scoped>
.tasker{
margin: 20px;
}
.tasker .taskInput {
font-size: 14px;
margin: 0 10px;
border: 0;
border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);
}
.tasker button {
border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);
border-radius: 3px;
box-shadow: 0 1px 2px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
</style>

5. Now, we need to import this component into our App.vue file:

<template>
<div id='app'>
<current-time class='col-4' />
<task-input class='col-6' />
</div>
</template>

<script>
import CurrentTime from './components/CurrentTime.vue';
import TaskInput from './components/TaskInput';

export default {
name: 'app',
components: {
CurrentTime,
TaskInput,
}
}
</script>

6. To run the server and see your component, you need to

open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve




Here is your component rendered and running:

How it works...

When you create an HTML input element and add a v-model to it, you are passing a
directive, built into Vue, that checks the input type and gives us sugar syntax for
the input. This handles the update of the value of the variable and the DOM.

This model is what is called two-way data binding. If the variable is changed by
the code, the DOM will re-render, and if it's changed by the DOM via user input,
such as the input-form, the JavaScript code can then execute a function.

Adding an event listener to an element

The most common method of parent-child communication in Vue is through props
and events. In JavaScript, it's common to add event listeners to elements of the
DOM tree to execute functions on specific events. In Vue, it's possible to add
listeners and name them as you wish, rather than sticking to the names that exist
on the JavaScript engine.

In this recipe, we are going to learn how to create custom events and how to emit
then.

Getting ready


The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in
the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing
TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Creating an input
form with two-way data binding' recipe.

Follow these steps to add an event listener in an element on Vue:

1. Create a new component or open the TaskInput.vue file.
2. At the <template> part, we are going to add a button element and add an event

listener to the button click event with the v-on directive. We will remove the {{
task }} variable from the component, as from now on it will be emitted and
won't be displayed on the component anymore:

<template>
<div class='cardBox'>
<div class='container tasker'>
<strong>My task is:</strong>
<input
type='text'
v-model='task'
class='taskInput' />
<button
v-on:click='addTask'>
Add Task
</button>
</div>
</div>
</template>

3. On the <script> part of the component, we need to add a method to handle the
click event. This method will be named addTask. The method will emit an
event called add-task and send the task on the data. After that, the task on the
component will be reset:

<script>
export default {


name: 'TaskInput',
data: () => ({
task: '',
}),
methods: {
addTask(){
this.$emit('add-task', this.task);
this.task = '';
},
}
};
</script>

4. On the App.vue file, we need to add an event listener bind on the component.
This listener will be attached to the add-task event. We will use the shortened
version of the v-on directive, @. When it's fired, the event will call the method,
addNewTask, which will send an alert that a new task was added:

<template>
<div id='app'>
<current-time class='col-4' />
<task-input
class='col-6'
@add-task='addNewTask'
/>
</div>
</template>

5. Now, let's create the addNewTask method. This will receive the task as a

parameter and will show an alert to the user, displaying that the task was
added:

<script>
import CurrentTime from './components/CurrentTime.vue';
import TaskInput from './components/TaskInput';

export default {
name: 'app',
components: {
CurrentTime,
TaskInput,
},
methods:{
addNewTask(task){
alert(`New task added: ${task}`);
},
},
}
</script>

6. To run the server and see your component, you need to

open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve



Here is your component rendered and running:

How it works...

The HTML events are read by Vue with the v-on event handling directive. When
we attached the v-on:click directive to the button, we added a listener to the button
so that a function will be executed when the user clicks on it.

The function is declared on the component methods. That function, when called,
will emit an event, denoting that any component using this component as a child
can listen to it with the v-on directive.

Removing the v-model from the input


What if I told you that behind the magic of the v-model there is a lot of code that
makes our magic sugar syntax happen? What if I told you that the rabbit hole can
go deep enough that you can control everything that can happen with the events
and values of the inputs?

We will learn how to extract the sugar syntax of the v-model directive and transform
it into the base syntax behind it.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in
the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing
TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Adding an event
listener to an element' recipe.

In the following steps, we will remove the v-model directive sugar syntax from the
input:

1. Open the TaskInput.vue file.
2. At the <template> block of the component, find the v-model directive. We'll

remove the v-model directive. Then, we need to add a new bind to the input
called v-bind:value or the shortened version, :value, and an event listener to the
HTML input element. We need to add an event listener to the input event with
the v-on:input directive or the shortened version, @input. The input bind will
receive the task value as a parameter and the event listener will receive a
value attribution, where it will make the task variable equal the value of the
event value:


<template>
<div class='cardBox'>
<div class='container tasker'>
<strong>My task is:</strong>
<input
type='text'
:value='task'
@input='task = $event.target.value'
class='taskInput'
/>
<button v-on:click='addTask'>
Add Task
</button>
</div>
</div>
</template>

3. To run the server and see your component, you need to

open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve

How it works...

As a sugar syntax, the v-model directive does the magic of automatically declaring
the bind and the event listener to the element for you, but the side effect is that you
don't have full control over what can be achieved.

As we've seen, the bound value can be a variable, a method, a computed property,
or a Vuex getter, for example. And for the event listener, it can be a function or a
direct declaration of a variable assignment. When an event is emitted and passed
to Vue, the $event variable is used to pass the event. In this case, as in normal
JavaScript, to catch the value of an input, we need to use the
event.target.value value.

Creating a dynamic to-do list


One of the first projects every programmer creates when learning a new language
is a to-do list. Doing this allows us to learn more about the language process
around the manipulation of states and data.

We are going to make our to-do list using Vue. We'll use what we have learned
and created in the previous recipes.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

There are some basic principles involved in making a to-do application—it must
have a list of tasks; those tasks can be marked as done and undone, and the list can
be filtered and sorted. Now, we are going to learn how to take the tasks and add
them to the task list.

To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue CLI, as learned in
the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing
TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Removing the v-
model from the input' recipe.

Now, follow these steps to create a dynamic to-do list with Vue and the previous
recipes:

1. In the App.vue file, we will create our array of tasks. This task will be filled
every time the TaskInput.vue component emits a message. We will add an
object to this array with the task, and the current date when the task was
created. The date when the task was finished will be undefined for now. To
do this, in the <script> part of the component, we need to create a method that
receives a task and add this task with the current date to the taskList array:


<script>
import CurrentTime from './components/CurrentTime.vue';
import TaskInput from './components/TaskInput';

export default {
name: 'TodoApp',
components: {
CurrentTime,
TaskInput,
},
data: () => ({
taskList: [],
}),
methods:{
addNewTask(task){
this.taskList.push({
task,
createdAt: Date.now(),
finishedAt: undefined,
})
},
},
}
</script>

2. Now, we need to render this list on the <template> part. We will iterate the list
of tasks using the v-for directive of Vue. This directive, when we use it with
an array, gives us access to two properties—the item itself and the index of
the item. We will use the item to render it and the index to make the key of
the element for the rendering. We need to add a checkbox that, when marked,
calls a function that changes the status of the task and the display when the
task was done:

<template>
<div id='app'>
<current-time class='col-4' />
<task-input class='col-6' @add-task='addNewTask' />
<div class='col-12'>
<div class='cardBox'>
<div class='container'>
<h2>My Tasks</h2>
<ul class='taskList'>
<li
v-for='(taskItem, index) in taskList'
:key='`${index}_${Math.random()}`'
>
<input type='checkbox'
:checked='!!taskItem.finishedAt'
@input='changeStatus(index)'
/>
{{ taskItem.task }}
<span v-if='taskItem.finishedAt'>
{{ taskItem.finishedAt }}
</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</template>



It's always important to remember that the key in the iterator needs to be unique. This is needed
because the render function needs to knows which elements were changed. In the example, we
added the Math.random() function to the index to generate a unique key, because the index of the
first elements of the array is always the same number when the number of elements is reduced.

3. We need to create the changeStatus function on the methods property of the

App.vue. This function will receive the index of the task as a parameter, then go
to the array of tasks and change the finishedAt property, which is our marker
for when a task is done:

changeStatus(taskIndex){
const task = this.taskList[taskIndex];
if(task.finishedAt){
task.finishedAt = undefined;
} else {
task.finishedAt = Date.now();
}
}

4. Now, we need to add the task text to the left-hand side of the screen. On the
<style> part of the component, we will make it scoped and add the custom
class:

<style scoped>
.taskList li{
text-align: left;
}
</style>

5. To run the server and see your component, you need to

open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:


How it works...

As we received the emitted message from the component, we hydrated the
message with more data and pushed it to a local array variable.

In the template we iterate this array, making it a list of tasks. This displays the
tasks we need to do, the checkbox to mark when the task is done, and the time that
a task was done.

When the user clicks on the checkbox, it executes a function, which marks the
current task as done. If the task is already done, the function will set the finishedAt
property as undefined.

Creating computed properties and
understanding how they work

Imagine that every time you have to fetch manipulated data, you need to execute a
function. Imagine you need to get specific data that needs to go through some
process and you need to execute it through a function every time. This type of
work would not be easy to maintain. Computed properties exist to solve these
problems. Using computed properties makes it easier to obtain data that needs
preprocessing or even caching without executing any other external memorizing
function.

Getting ready


The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

We will continue our to-do list project or you can create a new Vue project with
Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapt
er 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem.

Now, follow these steps to create a computed property and understand how it
works:

1. On the App.vue file, at the <script> part, we will add a new property between
data and method, called computed. This is where the computed properties will be
placed. We will create a new computed property called displayList, which will
be the one that will be used to render the final list on the template:

<script>
import CurrentTime from './components/CurrentTime.vue';
import TaskInput from './components/TaskInput';

export default {
name: 'TodoApp',
components: {
CurrentTime,
TaskInput
},
data: () => ({
taskList: []
}),
computed: {
displayList(){
return this.taskList;
},
},
methods: {
addNewTask(task) {
this.taskList.push({
task,
createdAt: Date.now(),
finishedAt: undefined
});
},
changeStatus(taskIndex){
const task = this.taskList[taskIndex];
if(task.finishedAt){



task.finishedAt = undefined;
} else {
task.finishedAt = Date.now();
}
}
}
};
</script>

The displayList property, for now, is just returning a cached value of the
variable, and not the direct variable as itself.

2. Now, on the <template> part, we need to change where the list is being fetched:

<template>
<div id='app'>
<current-time class='col-4' />
<task-input class='col-6' @add-task='addNewTask' />
<div class='col-12'>
<div class='cardBox'>
<div class='container'>
<h2>My Tasks</h2>
<ul class='taskList'>
<li
v-for='(taskItem, index) in displayList'
:key='`${index}_${Math.random()}`'
>
<input type='checkbox'
:checked='!!taskItem.finishedAt'
@input='changeStatus(index)'
/>
{{ taskItem.task }}
<span v-if='taskItem.finishedAt'>
{{ taskItem.finishedAt }}
</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</template>

3. To run the server and see your component, you need to

open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve

How it works...

When using the computed property to pass a value to the template, this value is now
cached. This means we will only trigger the rendering process when the value is
updated. At the same time, we made sure that the template doesn't use the variable


for rendering so that it can't be changed on the template, as it is a cached copy of
the variable.

Using this process, we get the best performance because we won't waste
processing time re-rendering the DOM tree for changes that have no effect on the
data being displayed. This is because if something changes and the result is the
same, the computed property caches the result and won't update the final result.

You can find more information about computed properties at https://v3.vuejs.org/gui

de/computed.html.

Displaying cleaner data and text with
custom filters

Sometimes you may find that the user, or even you, cannot read the Unix
timestamp or other DateTime formats. How can we solve this problem? When
rendering the data in Vue, it's possible to use what we call filters.

Imagine a series of pipes through which data flows. Data enters each pipe in one
shape and exits in another. This is what filters in Vue look like. You can place a
series of filters on the same variable, so it gets formatted, reshaped, and ultimately
displayed with different data while the code remains the same. The code of the
initial variable is immutable in those pipes.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global


How to do it...

We will continue our to-do list project or you can create a new Vue project with
Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapt
er 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem.

Follow these steps to create your first custom Vue filter:

1. In the App.vue file, at the <script> part, in the methods, create a formatDate

function inside this property. This function will receive value as a parameter
and enters the filter pipe. We can check if the value is a number because we
know that our time is based on the Unix timestamp format. If it's a number,
we will format based on the current browser location and return that
formatted value. If the passed value is not a number, we just return the passed
value:

<script>
import CurrentTime from './components/CurrentTime.vue';
import TaskInput from './components/TaskInput';

export default {
name: 'TodoApp',
components: {
CurrentTime,
TaskInput
},
data: () => ({
taskList: []
}),
computed: {
displayList() {
return this.taskList;
}
},
methods: {
formatDate(value) {
if (!value) return '';
if (typeof value !== 'number') return value;

const browserLocale =
navigator.languages && navigator.languages.length
? navigator.languages[0]
: navigator.language;
const intlDateTime = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(
browserLocale,
{
year: 'numeric',
month: 'numeric',
day: 'numeric',
hour: 'numeric',
minute: 'numeric'
});

return intlDateTime.format(new Date(value));
},
addNewTask(task) {





this.taskList.push({
task,
createdAt: Date.now(),
finishedAt: undefined
});
},
changeStatus(taskIndex) {
const task = this.taskList[taskIndex];
if (task.finishedAt) {
task.finishedAt = undefined;
} else {
task.finishedAt = Date.now();
}
}
}
};
</script>

2. On the <template> part of the component, we need to pass the variable to the
filter method. To do that, we need to find the taskItem.finishedAt property and
make it the parameter of the formatDate method. We will add some text to
denote that the task was Done at: at the beginning of the date:

<template>
<div id='app'>
<current-time class='col-4' />
<task-input class='col-6' @add-task='addNewTask' />
<div class='col-12'>
<div class='cardBox'>
<div class='container'>
<h2>My Tasks</h2>
<ul class='taskList'>
<li
v-for='(taskItem, index) in displayList'
:key='`${index}_${Math.random()}`'
>
<input type='checkbox'
:checked='!!taskItem.finishedAt'
@input='changeStatus(index)'
/>
{{ taskItem.task }}
<span v-if='taskItem.finishedAt'> |
Done at:
{{ formatDate(taskItem.finishedAt) }}
</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</template>

3. To run the server and see your component, open Terminal (macOS or Linux)

or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> npm run serve


Here is your component rendered and running:

How it works...

Filters are methods that receive a value and must return a value to be displayed on
the <template> section of the file, or used in a Vue property.

When we pass the value to the formatDate method, we know that it's a valid Unix
timestamp, so it was possible to invoke to a new Date class constructor, passing the
value as a parameter because the Unix timestamp is a valid date constructor.

The code behind our filter is the Intl.DateTimeFormat function, a native function that
can be used to format and parse dates to declared locations. To get the local
format, we use the navigator global variable.

You can find more information about Intl.DateTimeFormat at https://developer.mozilla.o
rg/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat.

Adding form validation with Vuelidate

Originally, JavaScript was used just for validating HTML forms before sending
these to servers; we didn't have any JavaScript frameworks or the JavaScript
ecosystem that we have today. However, one thing remains the same: form
validation is to be done first by the JavaScript engine before sending the forms to
the server.


We will learn how to use one of the most popular libraries on the Vue ecosystem
to validate our input form before sending it.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

We will continue our to-do list project or you can create a new Vue project with
Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapt
er 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem.

Now, follow these steps to add a form validation into your Vue project, and your
form component:

1. To install Vuelidate, you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> npm install vuelidate --save

2. To add the Vuelidate plugin to the Vue application, we need to import and

add it to Vue in the main.js file in the src folder:

import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import Vuelidate from 'vuelidate';
import './style.css';

Vue.config.productionTip = false
Vue.use(Vuelidate);

new Vue({
render: h => h(App),
}).$mount('#app')




3. In the TaskInput.vue file, we will add a new property to the Vue object. This

property is interpreted by the new plugin that was installed. At the end of the
object, we will add the validations property, and inside that property, we will
add the name of the model. The model is a direct name of the data or
computed property that the plugin will check for validation:

<script>
export default {
name: 'TaskInput',
data: () => ({
task: ''
}),
methods: {
addTask() {
this.$emit('add-task', this.task);
this.task = '';
}
},
validations: {
task: {}
}
};
</script>

4. Now, we need to import the rules that already exist on the plugins that we

want to use—those will be required and minLength. After the import, we will add
those rules to the model:

<script>
import { required, minLength } from 'vuelidate/lib/validators';

export default {
name: 'TaskInput',
data: () => ({
task: ''
}),
methods: {
addTask() {
this.$emit('add-task', this.task);
this.task = '';
}
},
validations: {
task: {
required,
minLength: minLength(5),
}
}
};
</script>

5. Now, we need to add the validation before emitting the event. We will use

the $touch built-in function to tell the plugin that the field was touched by the
user and check for validation. If there are any fields that had any interaction
with the user, the plugin will set the flags accordingly. If there are no errors,



we will emit the event and we will reset the validation with the $reset
function. To do this, we will change the addTask method:

addTask() {
this.$v.task.$touch();

if (this.$v.task.$error) return false;

this.$emit('add-task', this.task);
this.task = '';
this.$v.task.$reset();
return true;
}

6. To alert the user that there are some errors on the field, we will make the
input change the style to a complete red border and have a red text. To do
this, we will need to make a conditional class on the input field. This will be
attached directly to the model's $error property:

<template>
<div class='cardBox'>
<div class='container tasker'>
<strong>My task is:</strong>
<input
type='text'
:value='task'
@input='task = $event.target.value'
class='taskInput'
:class="$v.task.$error ? 'fieldError' : ''"
/>
<button v-on:click='addTask'>Add Task</button>
</div>
</div>
</template>

7. For the class, we can create a fieldError class in the style.css file in the src

folder:

.fieldError {
border: 2px solid red !important;
color: red;
border-radius: 3px;
}

8. To run the server and see your component, you need to

open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:




How it works...

Once installed, the Vuelidate plugin adds a new $v property to the Vue
prototype and checks for a new object property in the Vue object, called
validations. When this property is defined and has some rules, the plugins check for
the model's rules on each update.

Using this new Vue prototype, we can check inside our code for the errors inside
the rules we defined, and execute functions to tell the plugin that the field was
touched by the user to flag as a dirty field or reset it. Using those features, we're
able to add a new conditional class based on the rules that we defined on the task
model.

The task model is required and has a minimum of five characters. If those rules are
not met, the plugin will mark the model with an error. We take this error and use it
to show the user that the task field has an active error. When the user fulfills the
requirements, the display of the error disappears and the event can be emitted.

Creating filters and sorters for a list


When working with lists, it's common to find yourself with raw data. Sometimes,
you need to get this data filtered so that it's readable for the user. To do this, we
need a combination of the computed properties to form a final set of filters and
sorters.

In this recipe, we will learn how to create a simple filter and sorter that will
control our initial to-do task list.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

We will continue our to-do list project or you can create a new Vue project with
Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapt
er 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem.

Follow these steps to add a set of filters and sorts into your list:

1. In the App.vue file, at the <script> part, we will add new computed properties;
those will be for sorting and filtering. We will add three new computed
properties, baseList, filteredList, and sortedList. The baseList property will be
our first manipulation. We will add an id property to the task list via Array.map.
As JavaScript arrays start at zero, we will add 1 to the index of the array. The
filteredList property will filter the baseList property and return just the
unfinished tasks, and the sortedList property will sort the filteredList property
so that the last added id property will be the first displayed to the user:

<script>
import CurrentTime from "./components/CurrentTime.vue";
import TaskInput from "./components/TaskInput";

export default {
name: "TodoApp",



components: {
CurrentTime,
TaskInput
},
data: () => ({
taskList: [],
}),
computed: {
baseList() {
return [...this.taskList]
.map((t, index) => ({
...t,
id: index + 1
}));
},
filteredList() {
return [...this.baseList]
.filter(t => !t.finishedAt);
},
sortedList() {
return [...this.filteredList]
.sort((a, b) => b.id - a.id);
},
displayList() {
return this.sortedList;
}
},
methods: {
formatDate(value) {
if (!value) return "";
if (typeof value !== "number") return value;

const browserLocale =
navigator.languages && navigator.languages.length
? navigator.languages[0]
: navigator.language;
const intlDateTime = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(browserLocale, {
year: "numeric",
month: "numeric",
day: "numeric",
hour: "numeric",
minute: "numeric"
});

return intlDateTime.format(new Date(value));
},
addNewTask(task) {
this.taskList.push({
task,
createdAt: Date.now(),
finishedAt: undefined
});
},
changeStatus(taskIndex) {
const task = this.taskList[taskIndex];

if (task.finishedAt) {
task.finishedAt = undefined;
} else {
task.finishedAt = Date.now();
}
}
}
};
</script>





2. On the <template> part, we will add the Task ID as an indicator and change how

the changeStatus method sends the argument. Because now the index is
mutable, we can't use it as a variable; it's just a temporary index on the array.
We need to use the task id:

<template>
<div id="app">
<current-time class="col-4" />
<task-input class="col-6" @add-task="addNewTask" />
<div class="col-12">
<div class="cardBox">
<div class="container">
<h2>My Tasks</h2>
<ul class="taskList">
<li
v-for="(taskItem, index) in displayList"
:key="`${index}_${Math.random()}`"
>
<input type="checkbox"
:checked="!!taskItem.finishedAt"
@input="changeStatus(taskItem.id)"
/>
#{{ taskItem.id }} - {{ taskItem.task }}
<span v-if="taskItem.finishedAt"> |
Done at:
{{ formatDate(taskItem.finishedAt) }}
</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</template>

3. On the changeStatus method, we need to update our function too. As the index
now starts at 1, we need to decrease the index of the array by one to get the
real index of the element before updating it:

changeStatus(taskId) {
const task = this.taskList[taskId - 1];

if (task.finishedAt) {
task.finishedAt = undefined;
} else {
task.finishedAt = Date.now();
}
}

4. To run the server and see your component, you need to

open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:



How it works...

The computed properties worked together as a cache for the list and made sure there
were no side effects on the manipulation of the elements:

1. At the baseList property, we created a new array with the same tasks but added

a new id property to the task.

2. At the filteredList property, we took the baseList property and only returned

the tasks that weren't finished.

3. At the sortedList property, we sorted the tasks on the filteredList property by

their ID, in descending order.

When all the manipulation was done, the displayList property returned the result of
the data that was manipulated.

Creating conditional filters to sort list
data

After completing the previous recipe, your data should be filtered and sorted, but
you might need to check the filtered data or need to change how it was sorted. In
this recipe, we will learn how to create conditional filters and sort the data on a
list.

Using some basic principles, it's possible to gather information and display it in
many different ways.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

We will continue our to-do list project or you can create a new Vue project with
Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapt
er 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem.

Now, follow these steps to add a conditional filter to sort your list data:

1. In the App.vue file, at the <script> part, we will update the computed properties,

filteredList, sortedList, and displayList. We need to add three new variables to
our project, hideDone, reverse, and sortById. All three are going to be Boolean
variables and will start with a default value of false. The filteredList property
will check if the hideDone variable is true. If it is, it will have the same
behavior, but if not, it will show the whole list with no filter.
The sortedList property will check if the sortById variable is true. If it is, it will


have the same behavior, but if not, it will sort the list by the finished date of
the task. The displayList property will check if the reverse variable is true. If it
is, it will reverse the displayed list, but if not, it will have the same behavior:

<script>
import CurrentTime from "./components/CurrentTime.vue";
import TaskInput from "./components/TaskInput";

export default {
name: "TodoApp",
components: {
CurrentTime,
TaskInput
},
data: () => ({
taskList: [],
hideDone: false,
reverse: false,
sortById: false,
}),
computed: {
baseList() {
return [...this.taskList]
.map((t, index) => ({
...t,
id: index + 1
}));
},
filteredList() {
return this.hideDone
? [...this.baseList]
.filter(t => !t.finishedAt)
: [...this.baseList];
},
sortedList() {
return [...this.filteredList]
.sort((a, b) => (
this.sortById
? b.id - a.id
: (a.finishedAt || 0) - (b.finishedAt || 0)
));
},
displayList() {
const taskList = [...this.sortedList];

return this.reverse
? taskList.reverse()
: taskList;
}
},
methods: {
formatDate(value) {
if (!value) return "";
if (typeof value !== "number") return value;

const browserLocale =
navigator.languages && navigator.languages.length
? navigator.languages[0]
: navigator.language;

const intlDateTime = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(browserLocale, {
year: "numeric",
month: "numeric",
day: "numeric",






hour: "numeric",
minute: "numeric"
});

return intlDateTime.format(new Date(value));
},
addNewTask(task) {
this.taskList.push({
task,
createdAt: Date.now(),
finishedAt: undefined
});
},
changeStatus(taskId) {
const task = this.taskList[taskId - 1];

if (task.finishedAt) {
task.finishedAt = undefined;
} else {
task.finishedAt = Date.now();
}
}
}
};
</script>

2. On the <template> part, we need to add the controllers for those variables. We
will create three checkboxes, linked directly to the variables via the v-model
directive:

<template>
<div id="app">
<current-time class="col-4" />
<task-input class="col-6" @add-task="addNewTask" />
<div class="col-12">
<div class="cardBox">
<div class="container">
<h2>My Tasks</h2>
<hr />
<div class="col-4">
<input
v-model="hideDone"
type="checkbox"
id="hideDone"
name="hideDone"
/>
<label for="hideDone">
Hide Done Tasks
</label>
</div>
<div class="col-4">
<input
v-model="reverse"
type="checkbox"
id="reverse"
name="reverse"
/>
<label for="reverse">
Reverse Order
</label>
</div>
<div class="col-4">
<input
v-model="sortById"




type="checkbox"
id="sortById"
name="sortById"
/>
<label for="sortById">
Sort By Id
</label>
</div>
<ul class="taskList">
<li
v-for="(taskItem, index) in displayList"
:key="`${index}_${Math.random()}`"
>
<input type="checkbox"
:checked="!!taskItem.finishedAt"
@input="changeStatus(taskItem.id)"
/>
#{{ taskItem.id }} - {{ taskItem.task }}
<span v-if="taskItem.finishedAt"> |
Done at:
{{ formatDate(taskItem.finishedAt) }}
</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</template>

3. To run the server and see your component, you need to

open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:


How it works...

The computed properties worked together as a cache for the list and made sure there
weren't any side effects on the manipulation of the elements. With the conditional
process, it was possible to change the rules of the filtering and sorting through a
variable, and the display was updated in real-time:

1. At the filteredList property, we took the baseList property and returned just the
tasks that weren't finished. When the hideDone variable was false, we returned
the whole list without any filter.

2. At the sortedList property, we sorted the tasks on the filteredList property.

When the sortById variable was true, the list was sorted by ID in descending
order; when it was false, the sorting was done by the task finish time in
ascending order.

3. At the displayList property,  when the reverse variable was true, the final list

was reversed.

When all the manipulation was done, the displayList property returned the result of
the data that was manipulated.

Those computed properties were controlled by the checkboxes on the user screen, so
the user had total control of what they could see and how they could see it.

Adding custom styles and transitions

Adding styles in your components is a good practice, as it allows you to show
your user what is happening more clearly. By doing this, you are able to show a


visual response to the user and also give a better experience on your application.

In this recipe, we will learn how to add a new kind of conditional class binding.
We will use CSS effects mixed with the re-rendering that comes with each new
Vue update.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

We will continue our to-do list project or you can create a new Vue project with
Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapt
er 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem.

Follow these steps to add custom styles and transitions to your component:

1. In the App.vue file, we will add a conditional class to the list items for the tasks

that are done:

<template>
<div id="app">
<current-time class="col-4" />
<task-input class="col-6" @add-task="addNewTask" />
<div class="col-12">
<div class="cardBox">
<div class="container">
<h2>My Tasks</h2>
<hr />
<div class="col-4">
<input
v-model="hideDone"
type="checkbox"
id="hideDone"
name="hideDone"
/>
<label for="hideDone">
Hide Done Tasks
</label>


</div>
<div class="col-4">
<input
v-model="reverse"
type="checkbox"
id="reverse"
name="reverse"
/>
<label for="reverse">
Reverse Order
</label>
</div>
<div class="col-4">
<input
v-model="sortById"
type="checkbox"
id="sortById"
name="sortById"
/>
<label for="sortById">
Sort By Id
</label>
</div>
<ul class="taskList">
<li
v-for="(taskItem, index) in displayList"
:key="`${index}_${Math.random()}`"
:class="!!taskItem.finishedAt ? 'taskDone' : ''"
>
<input type="checkbox"
:checked="!!taskItem.finishedAt"
@input="changeStatus(taskItem.id)"
/>
#{{ taskItem.id }} - {{ taskItem.task }}
<span v-if="taskItem.finishedAt"> |
Done at:
{{ formatDate(taskItem.finishedAt) }}
</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</template>

2. At the <style> part of the component, we will create the CSS style sheet

classes for the taskDone CSS class. We need to make the list have a separator
between the items; then, we will make the list have a striped style; and when
they get marked as done, the background will change with an effect. To add
the separator between the lines and the striped list or zebra style, we need to
add a CSS style sheet rule that applies for each even nth-child of our list:

<style scoped>
.taskList li {
list-style: none;
text-align: left;
padding: 5px 10px;
border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
}

.taskList li:last-child {



border-bottom: 0px;
}

.taskList li:nth-child(even){
background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.05);
}
</style>

3. To add the effect on the background, when the task is done, at the end of the

<style> part, we will add a CSS animation keyframe that indicates the
background color change and apply this animation to the .taskDone CSS class:

<style scoped>
.taskList li {
list-style: none;
text-align: left;
padding: 5px 10px;
border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
}

.taskList li:last-child {
border-bottom: 0px;
}

.taskList li:nth-child(even){
background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.05);
}

@keyframes colorChange {
from{
background-color: inherit;
}
to{
background-color: rgba(0, 160, 24, 0.577);
}
}

.taskList li.taskDone{
animation: colorChange 1s ease;
background-color: rgba(0, 160, 24, 0.577);
}
</style>

4. To run the server and see your component, you need to

open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:







How it works...

Each time a new item in our application is marked as done, the displayList property
gets updated and triggers the re-rendering of the component.

Because of this, our taskDone CSS class has an animation attached to it that is
executed on rendering, showing a green background.

Using vue-devtools to debug your
application


vue-devtools is a must for every Vue developer. This tool shows us the depths of the
Vue components, routes, events, and vuex.

With the help of the vue-devtools extension, it's possible to debug our application,
try new data before changing our code, execute functions without needing to call
them in our code directly, and so much more.

In this recipe, we will learn more about how we can use the devtools to find more
information on your application and how it can be used to help your debug
process.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

You will need to install the vue-devtools extension in your browser:

Chrome extension—http://bit.ly/chrome-vue-devtools
Firefox extension—http://bit.ly/firefox-vue-devtools

How to do it...

We will continue our to-do list project or you can create a new Vue project with
Vue CLI, as learned in the 'Creating your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapt
er 2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem.

When developing any Vue application, it's always a good practice to develop with
vue-devtools to hand.

Follow these steps to understand how to use vue-devtools and how to properly
debug a Vue application:


1. To enter vue-devtools, you need to have it installed in your browser first, so

check the 'Getting ready' section of this recipe for the links to the extension
for Chrome or Firefox. In your Vue development application, enter browser
developer inspector mode. A new tab with the name Vue must appear:

2. The first tab that you are presented with is the Components tab. This tab
shows your application component tree. If you click on a component, you
will be able to see all the available data, the computed property, extra data
injected by plugins such as vuelidate, vue-router, or vuex. You can edit the data
to see the changes in the application in real time:


3. The second tab is for vuex development. This tab will show the history of

the mutations, the current state, and the getters. It's possible to check on each
mutation the passed payload and do time-travel mutations, to "go back in
time" in the vuex changes in the states:


4. The third tab is dedicated to event emitters in the application. All events that
are emitted in the application will be shown here. You can check the event
that was emitted by clicking on it. You can see the name of the event, the
type, who was the source of the event (in this case, it was a component), and
the payload:

5. The fourth tab is dedicated to the vue-router plugin. There, you can see the
navigation history, with all the metadata passed to the new route. You can
check all the available routes in your application:


6.  The fifth tab is a Performance tab. Here, you can check your component
loading time, the frames per second that your application is running by the
events that are happening in real time. This first screenshot shows the current
frames per second of the current application, and for the selected component:


This second screenshot shows the components lifecycle hooks performance a
the time it took to execute each hook:


7. The sixth tab is your Settings tab; here, you can manage the extension,

change how it looks, how it behaves internally, and how it will behave within
the Vue plugins:

8. The last tab is a refresh button for the vue-devtools. Sometimes, when the hot-

module-reload occurs or when some complex events happen in your application
component tree, the extension can lose track of what is happening. This
button forces the extension to reload and read the Vue application state again.

Components, Mixins, and Functional
Components

Building a Vue application is like putting a puzzle together. Each piece of
the puzzle is a component, and each piece has a slot to fill.

Components play a big part in Vue development. In Vue, each part of your
code will be a component—it could be a layout, page, container, or button,
but ultimately, it's a component. Learning how to interact with them and
reuse them is the key to cleaning up code and performance in your Vue
application. Components are the code that will, in the end, render something
on the screen, whatever the size might be.

In this chapter, we will learn about how we can make a visual component
that can be reused in many places. We'll use slots to place data inside our
components, create functional components for seriously fast rendering,
implement direct communication between parent and child components, and
finally, look at loading your components asynchronously.

Let's put these all those pieces together and create the beautiful puzzle that is
a Vue application.

In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:

Creating a visual template component
Using slots and named slots to place data inside your components
Passing data to your component and validating the data
Creating functional components
Accessing your children components data
Creating a dynamic injected component
Creating a dependency injection component
Creating a component mixin
Lazy loading your components


Technical requirements

In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue-CLI.

Attention Windows users: you need to install an NPM package called windows-build-
tools to be able to install the following required packages. To do so, open PowerShell as
an administrator and execute the following command:

> npm install -g windows-build-tools

To install Vue-CLI, you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
the Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global

Creating a visual template
component

Components can be data-driven, stateless, stateful, or a simple visual
component. But what is a visual component? A visual component is a
component that has only one purpose: visual manipulation.

A visual component could have a simple Scoped CSS with some div HTML
elements, or it could be a more complex component that can calculate the
position of the element on the screen in real-time.

We will create a card wrapper component that follows the Material Design
guide.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+



The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can use the Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we did
in the 'Creating Your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter
2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or we can start a new one.

To start a new project, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create visual-component

The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the
project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue,
and the spacebar to select an option. Choose the default option:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
❯ default (babel, eslint)
Manually select features

Now, let's follow these steps and create a visual template component:

1. Let's create a new file called MaterialCardBox.vue in the src/components

folder.

2. In this file, we will start with the template of our component. We need
to create the box for the card. By using the Material Design guide, this
box will have a shadow and rounded corners:

<template>
<div class="cardBox elevation_2">
<div class="section">
This is a Material Card Box
</div>
</div>
</template>

3. In the <script> part of our component, we will add just our basic name:


<script>
export default {
name: 'MaterialCardBox',
};
</script>

4. We need to create our elevation CSS stylesheet rules. To do this, create
a file named elevation.css in the style folder. There, we will create the
elevations from 0 to 24, to follow all the elevations on the Material
Design guide:

.elevation_0 {
border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
}

.elevation_1 {
box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2),
0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.14),
0 2px 1px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
}

.elevation_2 {
box-shadow: 0 1px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2),
0 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.14),
0 3px 1px -2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
}

.elevation_3 {
box-shadow: 0 1px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2),
0 3px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.14),
0 3px 3px -2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
}

.elevation_4 {
box-shadow: 0 2px 4px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2),
0 4px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.14),
0 1px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
}

.elevation_5 {
box-shadow: 0 3px 5px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2),
0 5px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.14),
0 1px 14px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
}

.elevation_6 {
box-shadow: 0 3px 5px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2),
0 6px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.14),
0 1px 18px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
}

5. For styling our card in the <style> part of the component, we need to set
the scoped attribute inside the <style> tag to make sure that the visual
style won't interfere with any other components within our application.
We will make this card follow the Material Design guide. We need to
import the Roboto font family and apply it to all elements that will be
wrapped inside this component:

<style scoped>
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?
family=Roboto:400,500,700&display=swap');
@import '../style/elevation.css';

*{
font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
.cardBox{
width: 100%;
max-width: 300px;









background-color: #fff;
position: relative;
display: inline-block;
border-radius: 0.25rem;
}
.cardBox > .section {
padding: 1rem;
position: relative;
}
</style>

6. To run the server and see your component, you need to open

Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:

How it works...

A visual component is a component that will wrap any component and place
the wrapped data with custom styles. As this component mixes with others,
it can form a new component without the need to reapply or rewrite any style
in your code.

Using slots and named slots to place
data inside your components

Sometimes the pieces of the puzzle go missing, and you find yourself with a
blank spot. Imagine that you could fill that empty spot with a piece that you
crafted yourself, not the original one that came with the puzzle box. That's a
rough analogy for what a Vue slot is.

Vue slots are like open spaces in your component that other components can
fill with text, HTML elements, or other Vue components. You can declare
where the slot will be and how it will behave in your component.

With this technique, you can create a component and, when needed,
customize it without any effort at all.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...


To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we
did in the Creating Your first project with Vue CLI recipe in Chapter
2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the
Creating a visual template component recipe.

Follow these instructions to create slots and named slots in components:

1. Let's open the file called MaterialCardBox.vue in the components folder.
2. In the <template> part of the component, we will need to add four main
sections on the card. Those sections are based on the Material Design
card anatomy and are the header, media, main section, and action areas. We
will use the default slot for the main section, and the rest will all be
named scopes. For some named slots, we will add a fallback
configuration that will be displayed if the user doesn't choose any
setting on the slot:

<template>
<div class="cardBox elevation_2">
<div class="header">
<slot
v-if="$slots.header"
name="header"
/>
<div v-else>
<h1 class="cardHeader cardText">
Card Header
</h1>
<h2 class="cardSubHeader cardText">
Card Sub Header
</h2>
</div>
</div>
<div class="media">
<slot
v-if="$slots.media"
name="media"
/>
<img
v-else
src="https://via.placeholder.com/350x250"
>
</div>
<div
v-if="$slots.default"
class="section cardText"
:class="{
noBottomPadding: $slots.action,
halfPaddingTop: $slots.media,
}"
>
<slot />
</div>


<div
v-if="$slots.action"
class="action"
>
<slot name="action" />
</div>
</div>
</template>

3. Now, we need to create our text CSS stylesheet rules for the

component. In the style folder, create a new file called cardStyles.css, and
there we will add the rules for the card text and headers:

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6{
margin: 0;
}
.cardText{
-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
text-decoration: inherit;
text-transform: inherit;
font-size: 0.875rem;
line-height: 1.375rem;
letter-spacing: 0.0071428571em;
}
h1.cardHeader{
font-size: 1.25rem;
line-height: 2rem;
font-weight: 500;
letter-spacing: .0125em;
}
h2.cardSubHeader{
font-size: .875rem;
line-height: 1.25rem;
font-weight: 400;
letter-spacing: .0178571429em;
opacity: .6;
}

4. In the <style> part of the component, we need to create some CSS

stylesheets to follow the rules of our design guide:

<style scoped>
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?
family=Roboto:400,500,700&display=swap");
@import "../style/elevation.css";
@import "../style/cardStyles.css";

* {
font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;
}

.cardBox {
width: 100%;
max-width: 300px;
border-radius: 0.25rem;
background-color: #fff;




position: relative;
display: inline-block;
box-shadow: 0 1px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.14),
0 3px 1px -2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
}
.cardBox > .header {
padding: 1rem;
position: relative;
display: block;
}
.cardBox > .media {
overflow: hidden;
position: relative;
display: block;
max-width: 100%;
}
.cardBox > .section {
padding: 1rem;
position: relative;
margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
display: block;
}
.cardBox > .action {
padding: 0.5rem;
position: relative;
display: block;
}
.cardBox > .action > *:not(:first-child) {
margin-left: 0.4rem;
}
.noBottomPadding {
padding-bottom: 0 !important;
}
.halfPaddingTop {
padding-top: 0.5rem !important;
}
</style>

5. In the App.vue file, in the src folder, we need to add elements to those

slots. Those elements will be added to each one of the named slots, and
for the default slot. We will change the component in the <template> part
of the file. To add a named slot, we need to use a directive called v-
slot: and then the name of the slot we want to use:

<template>
<div id="app">
<MaterialCardBox>
<template v-slot:header>
<strong>Card Title</strong><br>
<span>Card Sub-Title</span>
</template>
<template v-slot:media>
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/350x150">
</template>
<p>Main Section</p>
<template v-slot:action>
<button>Action Button</button>
<button>Action Button</button>


</template>
</MaterialCardBox>
</div>
</template>
For the default slot, we don't need to use a directive; it just needs to be wrapped in the
component to be placed in the <slot /> part of the component.

6. To run the server and see your component, you need to open

Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:

How it works...


Slots are places where you can put anything that can be rendered into the
DOM. We choose the position of our slot and tell the component where to
render when it receives any information.

In this recipe, we used named slots, which are designed to work with a
component that requires more than one slot. To place any information in that
component within the Vue single file (.vue) <template> part, you need to add
the v-slot: directive so that Vue is able to know where to place the
information that was passed down.

ponents-slots.html.

tps://material.io/components/cards/#anatomy.

Passing data to your component
and validating the data

You now know how to place data inside your component through slots, but
those slots were made for HTML DOM elements or Vue components.
Sometimes, you need to pass data such as strings, arrays, Booleans, or even
objects.

The whole application is like a puzzle, where each piece is a component.
Communication between components is an important part of it. The
possibility to pass data to a component is the first step to connect the puzzle,
and then validating the data is the final step to connect the pieces.

In this recipe, we will learn how to pass data to a component and validate the
data that was passed to the component.


Getting ready

The pre-requisite is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we
did in the recipe Creating Your first project with Vue CLI in Chapter
2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the
Using slots and name slots to place data inside your components recipe.

Follow these instructions to pass data to the component and validate it:

1. Let's open the file called MaterialCardBox.vue in the src/components folder.
2. In the <script> part of the component, we create a new property, called
props. This property receives the component data, and that data can be
used for visual manipulation, variables inside your code, or a function
that needs to be executed. In this property, we need to declare the name
of the attribute, the type, if it's required, and the validation function.
This function will be executed at runtime to validate whether the passed
attribute is a valid one:

<script>
export default {
name: 'MaterialCardBox',
inheritAttrs: false,
props: {
header: {
type: String,
required: false,
default: '',
validator: v => typeof v === 'string',
},
subHeader: {
type: String,


required: false,
default: '',
validator: v => typeof v === 'string',
},
mainText: {
type: String,
required: false,
default: '',
validator: v => typeof v === 'string',
},
showMedia: {
type: Boolean,
required: false,
default: false,
validator: v => typeof v === 'boolean',
},
imgSrc: {
type: String,
required: false,
default: '',
validator: v => typeof v === 'string',
},
showActions: {
type: Boolean,
required: false,
default: false,
validator: v => typeof v === 'boolean',
},
elevation: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 2,
validator: v => typeof v === 'number',
},
},
computed: {},
};
</script>

3. In the computed property, in the <script> part of the component, we need to
create a set of visual manipulation rules that will be used for rendering
the card. Those rules will be showMediaContent, showActionsButtons, showHeader,
and cardElevation. Each rule will check the received props and the
$slots objects to see whether the relevant card part needs to be rendered:

computed: {
showMediaContent() {
return (this.$slots.media || this.imgSrc) && this.showMedia;
},
showActionsButtons() {
return this.showActions && this.$slots.action;
},
showHeader() {
return this.$slots.header || (this.header || this.subHeader);
},
showMainContent() {
return this.$slots.default || this.mainText;
},


cardElevation() {
return `elevation_${parseInt(this.elevation, 10)}`;
},
},

4. After adding the visual manipulation rules, we need to add the

created rules to the <template> part of our component. They will affect
the appearance and behavior of our card. For example, if there is no
header slot defined, and there is a header property defined, we show the
fallback header. That header is the data that was passed down via props:

<template>
<div
class="cardBox"
:class="cardElevation"
>
<div
v-if="showHeader"
class="header"
>
<slot
v-if="$slots.header"
name="header"
/>
<div v-else>
<h1 class="cardHeader cardText">
{{ header }}
</h1>
<h2 class="cardSubHeader cardText">
{{ subHeader }}
</h2>
</div>
</div>
<div
v-if="showMediaContent"
class="media"
>
<slot
v-if="$slots.media"
name="media"
/>
<img
v-else
:src="imgSrc"
>
</div>
<div
v-if="showMainContent"
class="section cardText"
:class="{
noBottomPadding: $slots.action,
halfPaddingTop: $slots.media,
}"
>
<slot v-if="$slots.default" />
<p
v-else
class="cardText"


>
{{ mainText }}
</p>
</div>
<div
v-if="showActionsButtons"
class="action"
>
<slot
v-if="$slots.action"
name="action"
/>
</div>
</div>
</template>

5. To run the server and see your component, you need to
open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:


How it works...

Each Vue component is a JavaScript object that has a render function. This
render function is called when it is time to render it in the HTML DOM. A
single file component is an abstraction of this object.


When we are declaring that our component has unique props that can be
passed, it opens a tiny door for other components or JavaScript to place
information inside our component. We are then able to use those values
inside our component to render data, do some calculations, or make visual
rules.

In our case, using the single file component, we are passing those rules as
HTML attributes because vue-template-compiler will take those attributes and
transform them into JavaScript objects.

When those values are passed to our component, Vue first checks whether
the passed attribute matches the correct type, and then we execute our
validation function on top of each value to see whether it matches what we'd
expect.

After all of this is done, the component life cycle continues, and we can
render our component.

Creating functional components

The beauty of functional components is their simplicity. They're a stateless
component, without any data, computed property, or even a life cycle.
They're just a render function that is called when the data that is passed
changed.

You may be wondering how this can be useful. Well, a functional component
is a perfect companion for UI components that don't need to keep any data


inside them, or visual components that are just rendered components that
don't require any data manipulation.

As the name implies, they are simple function components, and they have
nothing more than the render function. They are a stripped-down version of
a component used exclusively for performance rendering and visual
elements.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, create your Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we did in
the recipe 'Creating Your first project with Vue CLI' in Chapter 2, Introducing
TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Passing data
to your component and validating the data' recipe.

Now, follow these instructions to create a Vue functional component:

1. Create a new file called MaterialButton.vue in the src/components folder.
2. In this component, we need to validate whether the prop we'll receive is
a valid color. To do this, install in the project the is-color module. You'll
need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm install --save is-color


3. In the <script> part of our component, we need to create the props object
that the functional component will receive. As a functional component
is just a render function with no state – it's stateless – the <script> part of
the component is trimmed down to props, injections, and slots. There will
be four props objects: backgroundColor, textColor, isRound, and isFlat. These
won't be required when installing the component, as we will have a
default value defined in props:

<script>
import isColor from 'is-color';

export default {
name: 'MaterialButton',
props: {
backgroundColor: {
type: String,
required: false,
default: '#fff',
validator: v => typeof v === 'string' && isColor(v),
},
textColor: {
type: String,
required: false,
default: '#000',
validator: v => typeof v === 'string' && isColor(v),
},
isRound: {
type: Boolean,
required: false,
default: false,
},
isFlat: {
type: Boolean,
required: false,
default: false,
},
},
};
</script>

4. In the <template> part of our component, we first need to add the

functional attribute to the <template> tag to indicate to the vue-template-
compiler that this component is a functional component. We need to
create a button HTML element, with a basic class attribute button and a
dynamic class attribute based on the props object received. Different
from the normal component, we need to specify the props property in
order to use the functional component. For the style of the button, we
need to create a dynamic style attribute, also based on props. To emit all
the event listeners directly to the parent, we can call the v-on directive
and pass the listeners property. This will bind all the event listeners



without needing to declare each one. Inside the button, we will add a div
HTML element for visual enhancement, and add <slot> where the text
will be placed:

<template functional>
<button
tabindex="0"
class="button"
:class="{
round: props.isRound,
isFlat: props.isFlat,
}"
:style="{
background: props.backgroundColor,
color: props.textColor
}"
v-on="listeners"
>
<div
tabindex="-1"
class="button_focus_helper"
/>
<slot/>
</button>
</template>

5. Now, let's make it pretty. In the <style> part of the component, we need
to create all the CSS stylesheet rules for this button. We need to add the
scoped attribute to <style> so that all the CSS stylesheet rules won't affect
any other elements in our application:

<style scoped>
.button {
user-select: none;
position: relative;
outline: 0;
border: 0;
border-radius: 0.25rem;
vertical-align: middle;
cursor: pointer;
padding: 4px 16px;
font-size: 14px;
line-height: 1.718em;
text-decoration: none;
color: inherit;
background: transparent;
transition: 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.8, 0.5, 1);
min-height: 2.572em;
font-weight: 500;
text-transform: uppercase;
}
.button:not(.isFlat){
box-shadow: 0 1px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2),
0 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.14),
0 3px 1px -2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
}


.button:not(.isFlat):focus:before,
.button:not(.isFlat):active:before,
.button:not(.isFlat):hover:before {
content: '';
position: absolute;
top: 0;
right: 0;
bottom: 0;
left: 0;
border-radius: inherit;
transition: 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.8, 0.5, 1);
}

.button:not(.isFlat):focus:before,
.button:not(.isFlat):active:before,
.button:not(.isFlat):hover:before {
box-shadow: 0 3px 5px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2),
0 5px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.14),
0 1px 14px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
}

.button_focus_helper {
position: absolute;
top: 0;
left: 0;
width: 100%;
height: 100%;
pointer-events: none;
border-radius: inherit;
outline: 0;
opacity: 0;
transition: background-color 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.8, 0.5, 1),
opacity 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.8, 0.5, 1);
}

.button_focus_helper:after, .button_focus_helper:before {
content: '';

6. To run the server and see your component, you need to open

Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:






How it works...

Functional components are as simple as a render function. They don't have
any sort of data, function, or access to the outside world.

They were first introduced in Vue as a JavaScript object render() function
only; later, they were added to vue-template-compiler for the Vue single file
application.


A functional component works by receiving two arguments: createElement and
context. As we saw in the single file, we only had access to the elements as
they weren't in the this property of the JavaScript object. This occurs
because as the context is passed to the render function, there is no
this property.

A functional component provides the fastest rendering possible on Vue, as it
doesn't depend on the life cycle of a component to check for the rendering; it
just renders each time data is changed.

om/package/is-color.

Accessing your children
components data

Normally, parent-child communications are done via events or props. But
sometimes, you need to access data, functions, or computed properties that
exist in the child or the parent function.

Vue provides a way to interact in both ways, opening doors to
communications and events, such as props and event listeners.

There is another way to access the data between the components: by using
direct access. This can be done with the help of a special attribute in the
template when using the single file component or a direct call of the object
inside the JavaScript. This method is seen by some as a little lazy, but there
are times when there really is no other way to do it than this.


Getting ready

The pre-requisite is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start your component, create your Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we did in
the 'Creating Your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2, Introducing
TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the 'Creating
functional components' recipe.

We're going to separate the recipe into four parts. The first three parts will
cover the creation of new components –  StarRatingInput, StarRatingDisplay, and
StarRating – and the last part will cover the parent-child direct manipulation
of the data and function access.

Creating the star rating input

We are going to create a star rating input, based on a five-star ranking
system.

Follow these steps to create a custom star rating input:

1. Create a new file called StarRatingInput.vue in the src/components folder.
2. In the <script> part of the component, create a maxRating property in the

props property that is a number, non-required, and has a default value of
5. In the data property, we need to create our rating property, with the
default value of 0. In the methods property, we need to create three
methods: updateRating, emitFinalVoting, and getStarName. The updateRating
method will save the rating to the data, emitFinalVoting will


call updateRating and emit the rating to the parent component through a
final-vote event, and getStarName will receive a value and return the icon
name of the star:

<script>
export default {
name: 'StarRatingInput',
props: {
maxRating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 5,
},
},
data: () => ({
rating: 0,
}),
methods: {
updateRating(value) {
this.rating = value;
},
emitFinalVote(value) {
this.updateRating(value);
this.$emit('final-vote', this.rating);
},
getStarName(rate) {
if (rate <= this.rating) {
return 'star';
}
if (Math.fround((rate - this.rating)) < 1) {
return 'star_half';
}
return 'star_border';
},
},
};
</script>

3. In the <template> part of the component, we need to create a

<slot> component to place the text before the star rating. We'll create a
dynamic list of stars based on the maxRating value that we received via
the props property. Each star that is created will have a listener attached
to it in the mouseenter, focus, and click events. mouseenter and focus, when
fired, will call the updateRating method, and click will call emitFinalVote:

<template>
<div class="starRating">
<span class="rateThis">
<slot />
</span>
<ul>
<li
v-for="rate in maxRating"
:key="rate"
@mouseenter="updateRating(rate)"


@click="emitFinalVote(rate)"
@focus="updateRating(rate)"
>
<i class="material-icons">
{{ getStarName(rate) }}
</i>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</template>

4. We need to import the Material Design icons into our application.

Create a new styling file in the styles folder called materialIcons.css, and
add the CSS stylesheet rules for font-family:

@font-face {
font-family: 'Material Icons';
font-style: normal;
font-weight: 400;
src: url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/materialicons/v48/flUhRq6tzZclQEJ-
Vdg-IuiaDsNcIhQ8tQ.woff2) format('woff2');
}

.material-icons {
font-family: 'Material Icons' !important;
font-weight: normal;
font-style: normal;
font-size: 24px;
line-height: 1;
letter-spacing: normal;
text-transform: none;
display: inline-block;
white-space: nowrap;
word-wrap: normal;
direction: ltr;
-webkit-font-feature-settings: 'liga';
-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}

5. Open the main.js file and import the created stylesheet into it. The css-
loader webpack will handle the processing of imported .css files in
JavaScript files. This will help development because you don't need to
re-import the file elsewhere:

import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import './style/materialIcons.css';

Vue.config.productionTip = false;

new Vue({
render: h => h(App),
}).$mount('#app');





6. To style our component, we will create a common styling file in the
src/style folder called starRating.css. There we will add the common
styles that will be shared between the StarRatingDisplay and StarRatingInput
components:

.starRating {
user-select: none;
display: flex;
flex-direction: row;
}
.starRating * {
line-height: 0.9rem;
}
.starRating .material-icons {
font-size: .9rem !important;
color: orange;
}

ul {
display: inline-block;
padding: 0;
margin: 0;
}

ul > li {
list-style: none;
float: left;
}

7. In the <style> part of the component, we need to create all the CSS

stylesheet rules. Then, on the StarRatingInput.vue component file located
in the src/components folder we need to add the scoped attribute to <style> so
that all the CSS stylesheet rules won't affect any other elements in our
application. Here, we will import the common styles that we created
and add new ones for the input:

<style scoped>
@import '../style/starRating.css';

.starRating {
justify-content: space-between;
}

.starRating * {
line-height: 1.7rem;
}

.starRating .material-icons {
font-size: 1.6rem !important;
}

.rateThis {
display: inline-block;
color: rgba(0, 0, 0, .65);








font-size: 1rem;
}
</style>

8. To run the server and see your component, you need to
open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:


Creating the StarRatingDisplay component

Now that we have our input, we need a way to display the selected choice to
the user. Follow these steps to create a StarRatingDisplay component:

1. Create a new component called StarRatingDisplay.vue in the src/components

folder.


2. In the <script> part of the component, in the props property, we need to

create three new properties: maxRating, rating, and votes. All three of them
will be numbers and non-required and have a default value. In the
methods property, we need to create a new method called getStarName,
which will receive a value and return the icon name of the star:

<script>
export default {
name: 'StarRatingDisplay',
props: {
maxRating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 5,
},
rating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 0,
},
votes: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 0,
},
},
methods: {
getStarName(rate) {
if (rate <= this.rating) {
return 'star';
}
if (Math.fround((rate - this.rating)) < 1) {
return 'star_half';
}
return 'star_border';
},
},
};
</script>

3. In <template>, we need to create a dynamic list of stars based on

the maxRating value that we received via the props property. After the list,
we need to display that we received votes, and if we receive any votes,
we will display them too:

<template>
<div class="starRating">
<ul>
<li
v-for="rate in maxRating"
:key="rate"
>
<i class="material-icons">
{{ getStarName(rate) }}
</i>


</li>
</ul>
<span class="rating">
{{ rating }}
</span>
<span
v-if="votes"
class="votes"
>
({{ votes }})
</span>
</div>
</template>

4. In the <style> part of the component, we need to create all the CSS

stylesheet rules. We need to add the scoped attribute to <style> so that all
the CSS stylesheet rules won't affect any other elements in our
application. Here, we will import the common styles that we created
and add new ones for the display:

<style scoped>
@import '../style/starRating.css';

.rating, .votes {
display: inline-block;
color: rgba(0,0,0, .65);
font-size: .75rem;
margin-left: .4rem;
}
</style>

5. To run the server and see your component, you need to
open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:



Creating the StarRating component


After creating the input and the display, we need to join both together in a
single component. This component will be the final component that we'll use
in the application.

Follow these steps to create the final StarRating component:

1. Create a new file called StarRating.vue in the src/components folder.
2. In the <script> part of the component, we need to import the

StarRatingDisplay and StarRatingInput components. In the props property, we
need to create three new properties: maxRating, rating, and votes. All three
of them will be numbers and non-required, with a default value. In
the data property, we need to create our rating property, with a default
value of 0, and a property called voted, with a default value of false. In
the methods property, we need to add a new method called vote, which
will receive rank as an argument. It will define rating as the received
value and define the inside variable of the voted component as true:

<script>
import StarRatingInput from './StarRatingInput.vue';
import StarRatingDisplay from './StarRatingDisplay.vue';

export default {
name: 'StarRating',
components: { StarRatingDisplay, StarRatingInput },
props: {
maxRating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 5,
},
rating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 0,
},
votes: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 0,
},
},
data: () => ({
rank: 0,
voted: false,
}),
methods: {
vote(rank) {
this.rank = rank;
this.voted = true;
},
},



};
</script>

3. In the <template> part, we will place both the components, displaying the

input of the rating:

<template>
<div>
<StarRatingInput
v-if="!voted"
:max-rating="maxRating"
@final-vote="vote"
>
Rate this Place
</StarRatingInput>
<StarRatingDisplay
v-else
:max-rating="maxRating"
:rating="rating || rank"
:votes="votes"
/>
</div>
</template>

Data manipulation on child components

Now that all of our components are ready, we need to add them to our
application. The base application will access the child component, and it will
set the rating to 5 stars.

Now, follow these steps to understand and manipulate the data in the child
components:

1. In the App.vue file, in the <template> part of the component, remove the
main-text attribute of the MaterialCardBox component and place it as the
default slot of the component.

2. Before the placed text, we will add the StarRating component. We will
add a ref attribute to it. This attribute will indicate to Vue to link this
component directly to a special property in the this object of the
component. In the action buttons, we will add the listeners for the click
event—one for resetVote and another for forceVote:

<template>
<div id="app">
<MaterialCardBox
header="Material Card Header"
sub-header="Card Sub Header"
show-media


show-actions
img-src="https://picsum.photos/300/200"
>
<p>
<StarRating
ref="starRating"
/>
</p>
<p>
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the
iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
</p>
<template v-slot:action>
<MaterialButton
background-color="#027be3"
text-color="#fff"
@click="resetVote"
>
Reset
</MaterialButton>
<MaterialButton
background-color="#26a69a"
text-color="#fff"
is-flat
@click="forceVote"
>
Rate 5 Stars
</MaterialButton>
</template>
</MaterialCardBox>
</div>
</template>

3. In the <script> part of the component, we will create a methods property,
and add two new methods: resetVote and forceVote. Those methods will
access the StarRating component and reset the data or set the data to a 5-
star vote, respectively:

<script>
import MaterialCardBox from './components/MaterialCardBox.vue';
import MaterialButton from './components/MaterialButton.vue';
import StarRating from './components/StarRating.vue';

export default {
name: 'App',
components: {
StarRating,
MaterialButton,
MaterialCardBox,
},
methods: {
resetVote() {
this.$refs.starRating.rank = 0;
this.$refs.starRating.voted = false;
},
forceVote() {
this.$refs.starRating.rank = 5;
this.$refs.starRating.voted = true;



},
},
};
</script>

How it works...

When the ref property is added to the component, Vue adds a link to the
referenced element to the $refs property inside the this property object of
JavaScript. From there, you have full access to the component.

This method is commonly used to manipulate HTML DOM elements
without the need to call for document query selector functions.

However, the main function of this property is to give access to the Vue
component directly, enabling you the ability to execute functions and see the
computed properties, variables, and changed variables of the component—
like full access to the component from the outside.

There's more...

In the same way that a parent can access a child component, a child can
access a parent component by calling $parent on the this object. An event can
access the root element of the Vue application by calling the $root property.

Creating a dynamic injected
component

There are some cases where your component can be defined by the kind of
variable you are receiving or the type of data that you have; then, you need


to change the component on the fly, without the need to set a lot of Vue v-if,
v-else-if, and v-else directives.

In those cases, the best thing to do is to use dynamic components, when a
computed property or a function can define the component that will be used
to be rendered, and the decision is taken in real time.

These decisions sometimes can be simple if there are two responses, but they
can be more complex with a long switch case, where you may have a long
list of possible components to be used.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we
did in the 'Creating Your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter
2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the
'Accessing your children components data' recipe.

Follow these steps to create a dynamic injected component:

1. Open the StarRating.vue component.
2. In the <script> part of the component, we need to create a computed

property with a new computed value called starComponent. This value will
check whether the user has voted. If they haven't, it will return the
StarRatingInput component; otherwise, it will return the StarRatingDisplay
component:


<script>
import StarRatingInput from './StarRatingInput.vue';
import StarRatingDisplay from './StarRatingDisplay.vue';

export default {
name: 'StarRating',
components: { StarRatingDisplay, StarRatingInput },
props: {
maxRating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 5,
},
rating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 0,
},
votes: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 0,
},
},
data: () => ({
rank: 0,
voted: false,
}),
computed: {
starComponent() {
if (!this.voted) return StarRatingInput;
return StarRatingDisplay;
},
},
methods: {
vote(rank) {
this.rank = rank;
this.voted = true;
},
},
};
</script>

3. In the <template> part of the component, we will remove both of the
existing components and replace them with a special component
called <component>. This special component has a named attribute that you
can point to anywhere that returns a valid Vue component. In our case,
we will point to the computed starComponent property. We will take all the
bind props that were defined from both of the other components and put
them inside this new component, including the text that is placed
in <slot>:

<template>
<component
:is="starComponent"
:max-rating="maxRating"



:rating="rating || rank"
:votes="votes"
@final-vote="vote"
>
Rate this Place
</component>
</template>

How it works...

Using the Vue special <component> component, we declared what the
component should render according to the rules set on the computed
property.

Being a generic component, you always need to guarantee that everything
will be there for each of the components that can be rendered. The best way
to do this is by using the v-bind directive with the props and rules that need to
be defined, but it's possible to define it directly on the component also, as it
will be passed down as a prop.

Creating a dependency injection
component

Accessing data directly from a child or a parent component without knowing
whether they exist can be very dangerous.

In Vue, it's possible to make your component behavior like an interface and
have a common and abstract function that won't change in the development
process. The process of dependency injection is a common paradigm in the
developing world and has been implemented in Vue also.


There are some pros and cons to using the internal Vue dependency
injection, but it is always a good way to make sure that your children's
components know what to expect from the parent component when
developing it.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we
did in the 'Creating Your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter
2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the
'Creating a dynamic injected component' recipe.

Now, follow these steps to create a dependency injection component:

1. Open the StarRating.vue component.
2. In the <script> part of the component, add a new property called provide.
In our case, we will just be adding a key-value to check whether the
component is a child of the specific component. Create an object in the
property with the starRating key and the true value:

<script>
import StarRatingInput from './StarRatingInput.vue';
import StarRatingDisplay from './StarRatingDisplay.vue';

export default {
name: 'StarRating',
components: { StarRatingDisplay, StarRatingInput },
provide: {
starRating: true,
},



props: {
maxRating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 5,
},
rating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 0,
},
votes: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 0,
},
},
data: () => ({
rank: 0,
voted: false,
}),
computed: {
starComponent() {
if (!this.voted) return StarRatingInput;
return StarRatingDisplay;
},
},
methods: {
vote(rank) {
this.rank = rank;
this.voted = true;
},
},
};
</script>

3. Open the StarRatingDisplay.vue file.
4. In the <script> part of the component, we will add a new property

called inject. This property will receive an object with a key named
starRating, and the value will be an object that will have
a default() function. This function will log an error if this component is
not a child of the StarRating component:

<script>
export default {
name: 'StarRatingDisplay',
props: {
maxRating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 5,
},
rating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 0,
},


votes: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 0,
},
},
inject: {
starRating: {
default() {
console.error('StarRatingDisplay need to be a child of
StarRating');
},
},
},
methods: {
getStarName(rate) {
if (rate <= this.rating) {
return 'star';
}
if (Math.fround((rate - this.rating)) < 1) {
return 'star_half';
}
return 'star_border';
},
},
};
</script>

5. Open the StarRatingInput.vue file.
6. In the <script> part of the component, we will add a new property
called inject. This property will receive an object with a key
named starRating, and the value will be an object that will have
a default() function. This function will log an error if this component is
not a child of the StarRating component:

<script>
export default {
name: 'StarRatingInput',
props: {
maxRating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 5,
},
},
inject: {
starRating: {
default() {
console.error('StarRatingInput need to be a child of
StarRating');
},
},
},
data: () => ({
rating: 0,
}),
methods: {


updateRating(value) {
this.rating = value;
},
emitFinalVote(value) {
this.updateRating(value);
this.$emit('final-vote', this.rating);
},
getStarName(rate) {
if (rate <= this.rating) {
return 'star';
}
if (Math.fround((rate - this.rating)) < 1) {
return 'star_half';
}
return 'star_border';
},
},
};
</script>

How it works...

At runtime, Vue will check for the injected property of starRating in the
StarRatingDisplay and StarRatingInput components, and if the parent component
does not provide this value, it will log an error on the console.

Using component injection is commonly used to maintain a way of a
common interface between bounded components, such as a menu and an
item. An item may need some function or data that is stored in the menu, or
we may need to check whether it's a child of the menu.

The main downside of dependency injection is that there is no more
reactivity on the shared element. Because of that, it's mostly used to share
functions or check component links.

Creating a component mixin


There are times where you find yourself rewriting the same code over and
over. However, there is a way to prevent this and make yourself far more
productive.

You can use what is called a mixin, a special code import in Vue that joins
code parts from outside your component to your current component.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we
did in the recipe 'Creating Your First Project with Vue CLI' in Chapter
2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the
'Creating a dependency injection component' recipe.

Let's follow these steps to create a component mixin:

1. Open the StarRating.vue component.
2. In the <script> part, we need to extract the props property into a new file
called starRatingDisplay.js that we need to create in the mixins folder. This
new file will be our first mixin, and will look like this:

export default {
props: {
maxRating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 5,
},
rating: {


type: Number,
required: false,
default: 0,
},
votes: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 0,
},
},
};

3. Back in the StarRating.vue component, we need to import this newly

created file and add it to a new property called mixin:

<script>
import StarRatingInput from './StarRatingInput.vue';
import StarRatingDisplay from './StarRatingDisplay.vue';
import StarRatingDisplayMixin from '../mixins/starRatingDisplay';

export default {
name: 'StarRating',
components: { StarRatingDisplay, StarRatingInput },
mixins: [StarRatingDisplayMixin],
provide: {
starRating: true,
},
data: () => ({
rank: 0,
voted: false,
}),
computed: {
starComponent() {
if (!this.voted) return StarRatingInput;
return StarRatingDisplay;
},
},
methods: {
vote(rank) {
this.rank = rank;
this.voted = true;
},
},
};
</script>

4. Now, we will open the StarRatingDisplay.vue file.
5. In the <script> part, we will extract the inject property into a new file

called starRatingChild.js, which will be created in the mixins folder. This
will be our mixin for the inject property:

export default {
inject: {
starRating: {
default() {
console.error('StarRatingDisplay need to be a child of



StarRating');
},
},
},
};

6. Back in the StarRatingDisplay.vue file, in the <script> part, we will extract

the methods property into a new file called starRatingName.js, which will be
created in the mixins folder. This will be our mixin for
the getStarName method:

export default {
methods: {
getStarName(rate) {
if (rate <= this.rating) {
return 'star';
}
if (Math.fround((rate - this.rating)) < 1) {
return 'star_half';
}
return 'star_border';
},
},
};

7. Back in the StarRatingDisplay.vue file, we need to import those newly

created files and add them to a new property called mixin:

<script>
import StarRatingDisplayMixin from '../mixins/starRatingDisplay';
import StarRatingNameMixin from '../mixins/starRatingName';
import StarRatingChildMixin from '../mixins/starRatingChild';

export default {
name: 'StarRatingDisplay',
mixins: [
StarRatingDisplayMixin,
StarRatingNameMixin,
StarRatingChildMixin,
],
};
</script>

8. Open the StarRatingInput.vue file.
9. In the <script> part, we remove the inject properties and extract

the props property into a new file called starRatingBase.js, which will be
created in the mixins folder. This will be our mixin for the props property:

export default {
props: {
maxRating: {
type: Number,
required: false,



default: 5,
},
rating: {
type: Number,
required: false,
default: 0,
},
},
};

10. Back in the StarRatingInput.vue file, we need to rename

the rating data property to rank, and in the getStarName method, we need to
add a new constant that will receive either the rating props or the
rank data. Finally, we need to import the starRatingChild mixin and the
starRatingBase mixin:

<script>
import StarRatingBaseMixin from '../mixins/starRatingBase';
import StarRatingChildMixin from '../mixins/starRatingChild';

export default {
name: 'StarRatingInput',
mixins: [
StarRatingBaseMixin,
StarRatingChildMixin,
],
data: () => ({
rank: 0,
}),
methods: {
updateRating(value) {
this.rank = value;
},
emitFinalVote(value) {
this.updateRating(value);
this.$emit('final-vote', this.rank);
},
getStarName(rate) {
const rating = (this.rating || this.rank);
if (rate <= rating) {
return 'star';
}
if (Math.fround((rate - rating)) < 1) {
return 'star_half';
}
return 'star_border';
},
},
};
</script>

How it works...



Mixins work as an object merge, but do make sure you don't replace an
already-existing property in your component with an imported one.

The order of the mixins properties is important as well, as they will be
checked and imported as a for loop, so the last mixin won't change any
properties from any of their ancestors.

Here, we took a lot of repeated parts of our code and split them into four
different small JavaScript files that are easier to maintain and improve
productivity without needing to rewrite code.

Lazy loading your components

webpack and Vue were born to be together. When using webpack as the bundler
for your Vue project, it's possible to make your components load when they
are needed or asynchronously. This is commonly known as lazy loading.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global



How to do it...

To start our component, we can create our Vue project with Vue-CLI, as we
did in the 'Creating Your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter
2, Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or use the project from the
'Creating a component mixin' recipe.

Now, follow these steps to import your component with a lazy loading
technique:

1. Open the App.vue file.
2. In the <script> part of the component, we will take the imports at the top

of the script and transform them into lazy load functions for each
component:

<script>
export default {
name: 'App',
components: {
StarRating: () => import('./components/StarRating.vue'),
MaterialButton: () => import('./components/MaterialButton.vue'),
MaterialCardBox: () =>
import('./components/MaterialCardBox.vue'),
},
methods: {
resetVote() {
this.$refs.starRating.rank = 0;
this.$refs.starRating.voted = false;
},
forceVote() {
this.$refs.starRating.rank = 5;
this.$refs.starRating.voted = true;
},
},
};
</script>

How it works...

When we declare a function that returns an import() function for each
component, webpack knows that this import function will be code-splitting,
and it will make the component a new file on the bundle.

The import() function was introduced as a proposal by the TC39 for module
loading syntax. The base functionality of this function is to load any module


that is declared asynchronously, avoiding the need to place all the files on
the first load.

Fetching Data from the Web via
HTTP Requests

Data is a part of everyday life nowadays. If it weren't for data, you wouldn't
be reading this book or trying to learn more about Vue.

Knowing how to fetch and send your data inside an application is a
requirement for a developer, not just an extra skill that's nice to have. The
best way to learn it is by practicing it and finding out how it is done behind
the scenes.

In this chapter, we will learn how to build our own API data manipulation
with the Fetch API and the most popular API library in the web right now,
axios.

In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:

Creating a wrapper for the Fetch API as an HTTP client
Creating a random cat image or GIF component
Creating your local fake JSON API server with MirageJS
Using axios as the new HTTP client
Creating different axios instances
Creating a request and response interceptor for axios
Creating a CRUD interface with axios and Vuesax

Technical requirements

In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue CLI.

Attention, Windows users! You need to install an NPM package called windows-build-tools
to be able to install the following required packages. To do this, open PowerShell as
administrator and execute the following command:
> npm install -g windows-build-tools


To install Vue CLI, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global

Creating a wrapper for the Fetch
API as an HTTP client

The Fetch API is the child of the old XMLHttpRequest. It has an improved API
and a new and powerful set of features completely based on Promises.

The Fetch API is both simple and based on a generic definition of two
objects, Request, and Response, which allow it to be used everywhere in the
browser. The browser Fetch API can be executed inside the window or the
service worker as well. There is no limitation on the usage of this API.

In this recipe, we will learn how to create a wrapper around the Fetch API to
make the API calls more simple.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can use the Vue project with Vue CLI we created
in the 'Creating Your first project with Vue CLI' recipe in Chapter 2,


Introducing TypeScript and the Vue Ecosystem, or we can start a new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create http-project

The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the
project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue,
and the Spacebar to select an option. Choose the default option:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
❯ default (babel, eslint)
Manually select features

Creating the wrapper

First, we need to create a new API wrapper to be used in this recipe. This
will be the main file we will use on all the HTTP methods.

Let's create the base wrapper by following these steps:

1. Create a new file called baseFetch.js in the src/http folder.
2. We will create an asynchronous function that will receive as an

argument the three variables of url, method, and options. This will be a
currying function, which the second function will receive as an
argument, type:

export default async (url, method, options = {}) => {
let httpRequest;
if (method.toUpperCase() === 'GET') {
httpRequest = await fetch(url, {
cache: 'reload',
...options,
});
} else {
httpRequest = fetch(url, {
method: method.toUpperCase(),
cache: 'reload',
...options,
});
}
return (type) => {
switch (type.toLocaleLowerCase()) {
case 'json':
return httpRequest.json();
case 'blob':


return httpRequest.blob();
case 'text':
return httpRequest.text();
case 'formdata':
return httpRequest.formData();
default:
return httpRequest.arrayBuffer();
}
};
};

Creating the API methods

Now we need to make our HTTP method function. These functions will use
the wrapper to execute the browser Fetch API and return the response.

Follow these steps to create each one of the API method calls:

1. Let's create a new file called fetchApi.js in the src/http folder.
2. We need to import the baseHttp from the file we created in the first step:

import baseHttp from './baseFetch';

Now in the following parts, we will create each one of the HTTP methods
that will be available in our wrapper.

GET method function

In these steps, we are going to create the HTTP GET method. Follow each of
the following instructions to create the getHttp function:

1. Create a constant called getHttp.
2. Define that constant as an asynchronous function that receives three

arguments, url, type, and options. The type argument will have the default
value of 'json'.

3. In this function return, we will execute the baseHttp function, passing the
url that we received, 'get' as the second argument, the options as the
third argument, and immediately execute the function with the type
argument we received:

export const getHttp = async (url, type = 'json', options) => (await
baseHttp(url, 'get', options))(type);


POST method function

In this part, we are creating the HTTP POST method. Follow these steps to
create the postHttp function:

1. Create a constant called postHttp.
2. Assign to that constant an asynchronous function that receives four

arguments, url, body, type, and options. The type argument will have the
default value of 'json'.

3. In this function return, we will execute the baseHttp function, passing the
url argument that we received, and 'post' as the second argument. In the
third argument, we will pass an object with the body variable, and the
deconstructed options argument that we received. Because of the
currying property of baseHttp, we will execute the returned function with
the type argument we received. The body is usually a JSON or a
JavaScript object. If this request is going to be a file upload, body needs
to be a FormData object:

export const postHttp = async (
url,
body,
type = 'json',
options,
) => (await baseHttp(url,
'post',
{
body,
...options,
}))(type);

PUT method function

Now we are creating an HTTP PUT method. Use the following steps to
create the putHttp function:

1. Create a constant called putHttp.
2. Assign to that constant an asynchronous function that receives four

arguments, url, body, type, and options. The type argument will have the
default value of 'json'.

3. In this function return, we will execute the baseHttp function, passing the

url that we received, and 'put' as the second argument. In the third
argument, we will pass an object with the body variable, and the


deconstructed options argument that we received. Because of the
currying property of baseHttp, we will execute the returned function with
the type argument we received. body is usually a JSON or a JavaScript
object, but if this request is going to be a file upload, body needs to be a
FormData object:

export const putHttp = async (
url,
body,
type = 'json',
options,
) => (await baseHttp(url,
'put',
{
body,
...options,
}))(type);

PATCH method function

It's time to create an HTTP PATCH method. Follow these steps to create the
patchHttp function:

1. Create a constant called patchHttp.
2. Assign to that constant an asynchronous function that receives four

arguments, url, body, type, and options. The type argument will have the
default value of 'json'.

3. In this function return, we will execute the baseHttp function, passing the
url that we received, and 'patch' as the second argument. In the third
argument, we will pass an object with the body variable, and the
deconstructed options argument that we received. Because of the
currying property of baseHttp, we will execute the returned function with
the type we received. body is usually a JSON or a JavaScript object, but if
this request is going to be a file upload, body needs to be a FormData
object:

export const patchHttp = async (
url,
body,
type = 'json',
options,
) => (await baseHttp(url,
'patch',
{


body,
...options,
}))(type);

UPDATE method function

In this section, we are creating an HTTP UPDATE method. Follow these
steps to create the updateHttp function:

1. Create a constant called updateHttp.
2. Assign to that constant an asynchronous function that receives four

arguments, url, body, type, and options. The type argument will have the
default value of 'json'.

3. In this function return, we will execute the baseHttp function, passing the
url that we received, and 'update' as the second argument. In the third
argument, we will pass an object with the body variable, and the
deconstructed options argument that we received. Because of the
currying property of baseHttp, we will execute the returned function with
the type we received. body is usually a JSON or a JavaScript object, but if
this request is going to be a file upload, body needs to be a FormData
object:

export const updateHttp = async (
url,
body,
type = 'json',
options,
) => (await baseHttp(url,
'update',
{
body,
...options,
}))(type);

DELETE method function

In this final step, we will create a DELETE HTTP method. Follow these
steps to create the deleteHttp function:

1. Create a constant called deleteHttp.
2. Assign to that constant an asynchronous function that receives four

arguments, url, body, type, and options. The type argument will have the
default value of 'json'.


3. In this function return, we will execute the baseHttp function, passing the
url that we received, and 'delete' as the second argument. In the third
argument, we will pass an object with the body variable, and the
deconstructed options argument that we received. Because of the
currying property of baseHttp, we will execute the returned function with
the type we received. body is usually a JSON or a JavaScript object, but if
this request is going to be a file upload, body needs to be a FormData
object:

export const deleteHttp = async (
url,
body,
type = 'json',
options,
) => (await baseHttp(url,
'delete',
{
body,
...options,
}))(type);

How it works...

In this recipe, we created a wrapper for the Fetch API that is presented on the
window element. This wrapper consists of a currying and closure function,
where the first function receives the URL data, method, and options for the
Fetch API, and the resulting function is the Fetch API response translator.

In the wrapper, the first part of the function will create our fetch request.
There, we need to check whether it's a GET method, so we just need to
execute it with the url parameter and omit the others. The second part of the
function is responsible for the conversion of the fetch response. It will switch
between the type parameter and execute the retrieving function according to
the correct one.

To receive the final data for your request, you always need to call the
response translator after the request, as in the following example:

getHttp('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1',
'json').then((response) => { console.log(response)); }


This will get the data from the URL and transform the response into a
JSON/JavaScript object.

The second part we made was the methods translator. We made functions for
each one of the REST verbs to be used more easily. The GET verb doesn't
have the ability to pass any body but all the others are capable of passing a
body in the request.

Creating a random cat image or
GIF component

It's common knowledge that the internet is made of many GIFs and videos of
cats. I'm sure that if we took down all cat-related content, we would have a
web blackout.

The best way to understand more about the Fetch API and how it can be
used inside a component is to make a random cat image or GIF component.


Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can use the Vue project with Vue CLI that we
used in the 'Creating a wrapper for the Fetch API as an HTTP client' recipe,
or we can start a new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create http-project

The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the
project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue,
and the Spacebar to select an option. Choose the default option:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
❯ default (babel, eslint)
Manually select features

Creating the component

In this recipe, we will be using the components created in Chapter 4,
Components, Mixins, and Functional Components, for visual elements. You
can achieve the same results with simple HTML elements.

We will divide the creation of this component in three steps: <script>,
<template>, and <style>.


Single file component <script> section

Follow these steps to create the <script> section of the single file component:

1. Create a new file called RandomCat.vue in the src/components folder and open

it.

2. Import the getHttp function from the fetchApi wrapper we made in

the 'Creating a wrapper for the Fetch API as an HTTP client' recipe:

import { getHttp } from '../http/fetchApi';

3. Asynchronously import the MaterialButton and MaterialCardBox components

in the component property:

components: {
MaterialButton: () => import('./MaterialButton.vue'),
MaterialCardBox: () => import('./MaterialCardBox.vue'),
},

4. In the data property, we need to create a new data value named

kittyImage, which will be by default an empty string:

data: () => ({
kittyImage: '',
}),

5. In the methods property, we need to create the getImage method, which will
fetch the image as a Blob and return it as a URL.createObjectURL. We also
need to create the newCatImage method that will fetch a new still image of
a cat and the newCatGif method that will fetch a new cat GIF:

methods: {
async getImage(url) {
return URL.createObjectURL(await getHttp(url, 'blob'));
},
async newCatImage() {
this.kittyImage = await
this.getImage('https://cataas.com/cat');
},
async newCatGif() {
this.kittyImage = await
this.getImage('https://cataas.com/cat/gif');
},
},

6. In the beforeMount life cycle hook, we need to make it asynchronous and

execute the newCatImage method:


async beforeMount() {
await this.newCatImage();
},

Single file component <template> section

Follow these steps to create the <template> section of the single file
component:

1. First, we need to add the MaterialCardBox component with a header and

sub-header, activate the media and action sections, and create the
<template> named slots for media and action:

<MaterialCardBox
header="Cat as a Service"
sub-header="Random Cat Image"
show-media
show-actions
>
<template
v-slot:media>
</template>
<template v-slot:action>
</template>
</MaterialCardBox>

2. In the <template> named slot for media, we need to add an <img> element

that will receive a URI Blob, which will be displayed when there is any
data in the kittyImage variable, or it will display a loading icon:

<img
v-if="kittyImage"
alt="Meow!"
:src="kittyImage"
style="width: 300px;"
>
<p v-else style="text-align: center">
<i class="material-icons">
cached
</i>
</p>

3. At the <template> named slot for action, we will create two buttons, one

for fetching cat images and another for fetching cat GIFs, and both will
have an event listener on the @click directive that calls a function that
fetches the corresponding image:

<MaterialButton
background-color="#4ba3c7"


text-color="#fff"
@click="newCatImage"
>
<i class="material-icons">
pets
</i> Cat Image
</MaterialButton>
<MaterialButton
background-color="#005b9f"
text-color="#fff"
@click="newCatGif"
>
<i class="material-icons">
pets
</i> Cat GIF
</MaterialButton>

Single file component <style> section

In the <style> part of the component, we need to set the body font-size for the
CSS style calculation based on rem and em:

<style>
body {
font-size: 14px;
}
</style>

Getting up and running with your new component

Follow these steps to add your component to your Vue application:

1. Open the App.vue file in the src folder.
2. In the components property, asynchronously import the RandomCat.vue

component:

<script>
export default {
name: 'App',
components: {
RandomCat: () => import('./components/RandomCat'),
},
};
</script>

3. In the <template> section of the file, declare the imported component:

<template>
<div id="app">
<random-cat />


</div>
</template>

To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute
the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:


How it works...

Using the getHttp wrapper, the component was able to get the URL and
retrieve it as a Blob type. With this response, we can use the URL.createObjectUrl
navigator method and pass the Blob as an argument to get a valid image URL
that can be used as the src attribute.

You can find more information about URL.createObjectUrl at https://developer.moz
illa.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL.

Creating your fake JSON API
server with MirageJS

Faking data for testing, developing, or designing is always a problem. You
need to have a big JSON or make a custom server to handle any data
changes when presenting the application at the development stage.

There is now a way to help developers and UI designers achieve this without
needing to code an external server – a new tool called MirageJS, a server
emulator that runs on the browser.

In this recipe, we will learn how to use the MirageJS as a mock server and
execute HTTP requests on it.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:


Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can use the Vue project with Vue CLI that we
did in the 'Creating a wrapper for the Fetch API as an HTTP client' recipe,
or we can start a new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create visual-component

The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the
project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue,
and the Spacebar to select an option. Choose the default option:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
❯ default (babel, eslint)
Manually select features

Creating the mock server

In this recipe, we will be using the getHttp function from the fetchApi wrapper
we made in the 'Creating a wrapper for the Fetch API as an HTTP
client' recipe.

Work through the next steps and sections to create your MirageJS mock server:

Install the MirageJS server to your packages. You need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute
the following command:

> npm install --save miragejs


The version used in this recipe was 0.1.32. Watch for any changes to MirageJS, as there
are no current LTS versions of the library yet.

Now in the following sections, we will create each one of the HTTP methods
that will be mocked by the MirageJS server.

Creating the mock database

In this section, we will create a MirageJS database that will be used to store the
temporary data. Follow these steps to create it:

1. Create a new file called db.js file in the src/server folder for the initial

loaded data.

2. We need to make a JavaScript object the default export for this file,

containing the initial data that we want the server to have:

export default {
users: [
{
name: 'Heitor Ramon Ribeiro',
email: 'heitor@example.com',
age: 31,
country: 'Brazil',
active: true,
},
],
};

Creating the GET route function

In this section, we are going to create the HTTP GET method that will be
mocked by the MirageJS server. Follow these steps to create it:

1. For the GET methods, we need to create a new file called get.js in the

src/server folder.

2. For this recipe, we will make a generic getFrom function that receives a
key as an argument and returns a function. This returned function
returns a direct point to the local database with the indicated key:

export const getFrom = key => ({ db }) => db[key];

export default {
getFrom,
};



Creating the POST route function

In this section, we are going to create the HTTP POST method, that will be
mocked by the MirageJS server. Follow these steps to create it:

1. For the POST methods, we need to create a new file called post.js in the

src/server folder.

2. For this recipe, we will make a generic postFrom function that receives a
key as an argument and returns a function. This returned function will
parse the data property of the HTTP request body and returns an internal
function of the server schema that inserts the data inside the database.
Using the key argument, the schema knows which table we are handling:

export const postFrom = key => (schema, request) => {
const { data } = typeof request.requestBody === 'string'
? JSON.parse(request.requestBody)
: request.requestBody;

return schema.db[key].insert(data);
};

export default {
postFrom,
};

Creating the PATCH route function

In this section, we are going to create the HTTP PATCH method that will be
mocked by the MirageJS server. Follow these steps to create it:

1. For the PATCH methods, we need to create a new file called patch.js in

the src/server folder.

2. For this recipe, we will make a generic patchFrom function that receives a
key as an argument and returns a function. This returned function will
parse the data property of the HTTP request body and returns an internal
function of the server schema that updates a specific object with the id
property that was passed along with the data. Using the key argument,
the schema knows which table we are handling:

export const patchFrom = key => (schema, request) => {
const { data } = typeof request.requestBody === 'string'
? JSON.parse(request.requestBody)




: request.requestBody;

return schema.db[key].update(data.id, data);
};

export default {
patchFrom,
};

Creating the DELETE route function

In this section, we are going to create the HTTP DELETE method that will
be mocked by the MirageJS server. Follow these steps to create it:

1. For the DELETE methods, we need to create a new file called delete.js

in the src/server folder.

2. For this recipe, we will make a generic patchFrom function that receives a
key as an argument and returns a function. This returned function will
parse the data property of the HTTP request body and return an internal
function of the server schema that deletes a specific object with the id
property, which was passed to the server via the route REST parameter.
Using the key argument, the schema knows which table we are handling:

export const deleteFrom = key => (schema, request) =>
schema.db[key].remove(request.params.id);

export default {
deleteFrom,
};

Creating the server

In this section, we are going to create the MirageJS server and the routes that
will be available. Follow these steps to create the server:

1. Create a new file called server.js inside the src/server folder.
2. Next, we need to import the Server class, the baseData, and the router

methods:

import { Server } from 'miragejs';
import baseData from './db';
import { getFrom } from './get';
import { postFrom } from './post';
import { patchFrom } from './patch';
import { deleteFrom } from './delete';





3. Create a global variable to the window scope, called server, and set this

variable as a new execution of the Server class:

window.server = new Server({});

4. In the Server class construction options, add a new property called seeds.
This property is a function that receives the server (srv) as an argument
and executes the srv.db.loadData function passing the baseDate as a
parameter:

seeds(srv) {
srv.db.loadData({ ...baseData });
},

5. Now we need to add in the same construction options to a new property
called routes, which will create the mock server routes. This property is
a function and on the function body, we will need to set the namespace of
the mock server and the delay in milliseconds within which the server
will respond. There will be four routes. For the Create route, we will
make a new route called /users that listen to the POST method. For the
Read route, we will make a new route called /users that listen to the
GET method. For the Update route, we will make a new route called
/users/:id that listens to the PATCH method, and finally, for the Delete
route, we will make a new route called /users that listen to the DELETE
method:

routes() {
this.namespace = 'api';

this.timing = 750;

this.get('/users', getFrom('users'));

this.post('/users', postFrom('users'));

this.patch('/users/:id', patchFrom('users'));

this.delete('/users/:id', deleteFrom('users'));
},

Adding to the application

In this section, we will add the MirageJS server to the Vue application. Follow
these steps to make the server available to your Vue application:







1. Open the main.js file in the src folder.
2. We need to declare the server as the first imported declaration, so it's

available on the initial loading of the application:

import './server/server';
import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';

Vue.config.productionTip = false;

new Vue({
render: h => h(App),
}).$mount('#app');

Creating the component

Now that we have our server, we need to test it. To do so, we will create a
simple application that will run each of the HTTP methods and show the
results of each call.

In the following parts, we will create a simple Vue application.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these steps to create it:

1. Open the App.vue file in the src folder.
2. Import the getHttp, postHttp, patchHttp, and deleteHTTP methods from the

fetchHttp wrapper that we made in the 'Creating a wrapper for the Fetch
API as an HTTP client' recipe:

import {
getHttp,
postHttp,
patchHttp,
deleteHttp,
} from './http/fetchApi';

3. In the data property, we need to create three new properties to be used,

response, userData, and userId:

data: () => ({
response: undefined,
userData: '',




userId: undefined,
}),

4. In the methods property, we need to create four new methods, getAllUsers,

createUser, updateUser, and deleteUser:

methods: {
async getAllUsers() {
},
async createUser() {
},
async updateUser() {
},
async deleteUser() {
},
},

5. In the getAllUsers method, we will set the response data property as the

result of the getHttp function of the api/users route:

async getAllUsers() {
this.response = await getHttp(`${window.location.href}api/users`);
},

6. In the createUser method, we will receive a data argument, which will be
an object that we will pass to the postHttp on the api/users route, and after
that, we will execute the getAllUsers method:

async createUser(data) {
await postHttp(`${window.location.href}api/users`, { data });
await this.getAllUsers();
},

7. For the updateUser method, we will receive a data argument, which will
be an object that we will pass to the patchHttp on the api/users/:id route,
using the id property on the object as the :id on the route. After that, we
will execute the getAllUsers method:

async updateUser(data) {
await patchHttp(`${window.location.href}api/users/${data.id}`,
{ data });
await this.getAllUsers();
},

8. Finally, on the deleteUser method, we receive the user id as the argument,
which is a number, then we pass it to the deleteHttp on the api/users/:id
route, using the ID as :id. After that, we execute the getAllUsers method:


async deleteUser(id) {
await deleteHttp(`${window.location.href}api/users/${id}`, {},
'text');
await this.getAllUsers();
},

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these steps to create it:

1. At the top of the template, we need to add the response property,

wrapped in an <pre> HTML element:

<h3>Response</h3>
<pre>{{ response }}</pre>

2. For the creation and updating of a user, we need to create a textarea
HTML input with a v-model directive bound to the userData property:

<hr/>
<h1> Create / Update User </h1>
<label for="userData">
User JSON:
<textarea
id="userData"
v-model="userData"
rows="10"
cols="40"
style="display: block;"
></textarea>
</label>

3. To send this data, we need to create two buttons, both having an event
listener bound on the click event with the @click directive targeting the
createUser and updateUser respectively, and passing the userData in the
execution:

<button
style="margin: 20px;"
@click="createUser(JSON.parse(userData))"
>
Create User
</button>
<button
style="margin: 20px;"
@click="updateUser(JSON.parse(userData))"
>
Update User
</button>


4. To execute the DELETE method, we need to create an input HTML
element of type number with a v-model directive bound to the userId
property:

<h1> Delete User </h1>
<label for="userData">
User Id:
<input type="number" step="1" v-model="userId">
</label>

5. Finally, to execute this action we need to create a button that will have
an event listener bound on the click event with the @click directive,
targeting the deleteUser method and passing the userId property on the
execution:

<button
style="margin: 20px;"
@click="deleteUser(userId)"
>
Delete User
</button>

To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute
the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:


How it works...

MirageJS works like an interceptor of every HTTP request that happens on the
application. The server intercepts all XHR (XMLHttpRequest) executions
on the browsers and checks for the route to see whether it matches any one


of the routes created on server creation. If it matches, the server will execute
the function accordingly on the respective route.

Working as a simple REST server with basic CRUD functions, the server has
a schema-like database structure that helps in the process of making a virtual
database for storing the data.

Using axios as the new HTTP client

When you need a library for HTTP requests, there is no doubt that axios is
the one you should go to. Used by more than 1.5 million open-source
projects and countless closed ones, this library is the king of HTTP libraries.

It's built to work with most browsers and provides one of the most complete
sets of options out there – you can customize everything in your request.

In this recipe, we will learn how to change our Fetch API wrapper to axios
and start working around it.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global


How to do it...

To start our component, we can use the Vue project with Vue CLI that we
made in the 'Creating your fake JSON API Server with MirageJS' recipe, or
we can start a new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create http-project

The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the
project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue,
and the Spacebar to select an option. Choose the default option:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
❯ default (babel, eslint)
Manually select features

Changing from the Fetch API to Axios

In the next steps, we will change the Fetch API used in the HTTP wrapper
for the axios library. Follow these steps to change it correctly:

1. Install axios in your packages. You need to open Terminal (macOS or
Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the
following command:

> npm install --save axios

The version used in this recipe was 0.19.0. Watch for changes to axios, as there is no LTS
version of the library yet.

2. Open the baseFetch.js file inside the src/http folder.
3. Simplify the method so that it will receive three arguments, url, method,
and options, and return an axios method, calling the HTTP request with
the methods passed as the constructor of the instance:

import axios from 'axios';

export default async (url, method, options = {}) => axios({
method: method.toUpperCase(),
url,



...options,
});

Changing the GET method function

In this part, we are changing the HTTP GET method. Follow these
instructions to change the getHttp function:

1. Open the fetchApi.js file inside the src/http folder.
2. In the getHttp function, we will add a new argument param, and remove

the currying functions:

export const getHttp = async (
url,
params,
options,
) => baseHttp(url,
'get',
{
...options,
params,
});

Changing the POST method function

In this part, we are changing the HTTP POST method. Follow these
instructions to change the postHttp function:

1. Open the fetchApi.js file inside the http folder.
2. In the postHttp function, we will change the body argument to data, and

remove the currying functions:

export const postHttp = async (
url,
data,
options,
) => baseHttp(url,
'post',
{
data,
...options,
});

Changing the PUT method function


In this part, we are changing the HTTP PUT method. Follow these
instructions to change the putHttp function:

1. Open the fetchApi.js file inside the http folder.
2. In the putHttp function, we will change the body argument to data, and

remove the currying functions:

export const putHttp = async (
url,
data,
options,
) => baseHttp(url,
'put',
{
data,
...options,
});

Changing the PATCH method function

In this part, we are changing the HTTP PATCH method. Follow these
instructions to change the patchHttp function:

1. Open the fetchApi.js file inside the http folder.
2. In the patchHttp function, we will change the body argument to data, and

remove the currying functions:

export const patchHttp = async (
url,
data,
options,
) => baseHttp(url,
'patch',
{
data,
...options,
});

Changing the UPDATE method function

In this part, we are changing the HTTP UPDATE method. Follow these
instructions to change the updateHttp function:

1. Open the fetchApi.js file inside the http folder.


2. In the updateHttp function, we will add a new argument param, and

remove the currying functions:

export const updateHttp = async (
url,
data,
options,
) => baseHttp(url,
'update',
{
data,
...options,
});

Changing the DELETE method function

In this part, we are changing the HTTP DELETE method. Follow these
instructions to change the deleteHttp function:

1. Open the fetchApi.js file inside the http folder.
2. On the deleteHttp function, we will change the body argument to data, and

remove the currying functions:

export const deleteHttp = async (
url,
data,
options,
) => baseHttp(url,
'delete',
{
data,
...options,
});

Changing the component

In this part, we will change how the component works with the new
functions. Follow these instructions to change it correctly:

1. Open the App.vue file inside the src folder.
2. In the getAllUsers method, we will need to change the way the response
is defined because axios gives us a completely different response object
than the Fetch API:

async getAllUsers() {
const { data } = await getHttp(`${window.location.href}api/users`);


this.response = data;
},

3. In the deleteUser method, we can just pass the URL as the parameter:

async deleteUser(id) {
await deleteHttp(`${window.location.href}api/users/${id}`);
await this.getAllUsers();
},

To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute
the following command:

> npm run serve

How it works...

When we made the wrapper for the Fetch API, we used a technique of
abstracting the API into another interface, which made it possible to change
from the Fetch API to the axios library. By doing this we were able to
improve the methods and simplify how the functions are called and handled.
For example, the GET method can now receive a new argument called
params, which are objects of URL query parameters that will be
automatically injected into the URL.

We also had to change the way that the responses were interpreted because
axios have a more robust and complete response object than the Fetch API,
which returns just the fetched response itself.

Creating different axios instances

When using axios, you can have multiple instances of it running with none of
them interfering with each other. For example, you have an instance pointing


to a user API that is on version 1 and another pointing to the payment API
that is on version 2, both sharing the same namespace.

Here, we are going to learn how to create various axios instances, so you are
able to work with as many API namespaces as you want without problems or
interference.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can use the Vue project with Vue CLI that we
did in the 'Using axios as the new HTTP client' recipe, or we can start a new
one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create http-project

The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the
project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue,
and the Spacebar to select an option. Choose the default option:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
❯ default (babel, eslint)
Manually select features

Changing the HTTP function


When creating multiple axios instances, the process of calling the axios library
changes. Because of that, we need to change how our HTTP wrapper
instantiates the axios library.

In the following parts, we will change how the HTTP wrapper works with
the creation of a new axios instance, and make it available to the application.

Changing the HTTP Fetch wrapper

In the following steps, we will create a new custom axios instance that will be
used in the HTTP wrapper. Follow these instructions to add the new instance
to the application:

1. Open the baseFetch.js file in the src/http folder.
2. We need to create a new factory function called createAxios to generate a

new axios instance each time it's executed:

export function createAxios(options = {}) {
return axios.create({
...options,
});
}

3. Now we need to create the localApi constant, the value of which will be

the result of the execution of the createAxios factory:

const localApi = createAxios();

4. For the JSONPlaceHolder we will create a constant that will be exported,

named jsonPlaceholderApi, the value of which will be the execution of the
createAxios factory. We will also pass an object as an argument with the
baseURL property defined:

export const jsonPlaceholderApi = createAxios({
baseURL: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/',
});

5. In the export default function, we need to change from axios to localApi:

export default async (url, method, options = {}) => localApi({
method: method.toUpperCase(),
url,


...options,
});

Changing the HTTP methods function

In this part, we will change how the HTTP methods will work with the new
axios instances. Follow the instructions to do it correctly:

1. Open the fetchApi.js file in the src/http folder.
2. We will import the jsonPlaceholderApi function from baseFetch as an extra

imported value:

import baseHttp, { jsonPlaceholderApi } from './baseFetch';

3. We need to create a new constant called getTodos that will be exported.

This constant will be a function that will receive a userId as a parameter
and return the GET function from axios, with the userId parameter we
just received, inside a configuration object in a property called params:

export const getTodos = async userId => jsonPlaceholderApi.get('todos',
{
params: {
userId,
},
});

Changing the MirageJS server

In this part, we will change how the MirageJS server works with the new axios
instance that was created. Follow the instructions to do it correctly:

1. Open the server.js file in the src/server folder.
2. On the routes property in the constructor object, we need to add a

passthrough declaration, which will indicate to the MirageJS that all the
calls to that URL won't be intercepted:

import { Server } from 'miragejs';
import baseData from './db';
import { getFrom } from './get';
import { postFrom } from './post';
import { patchFrom } from './patch';
import { deleteFrom } from './delete';

window.server = new Server({



seeds(srv) {
srv.db.loadData({ ...baseData });
},

routes() {
this.passthrough();
this.passthrough('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/**');

this.namespace = 'api';

this.timing = 750;

this.get('/users', getFrom('users'));

this.post('/users', postFrom('users'));

this.patch('/users/:id', patchFrom('users'));

this.delete('/users/:id', deleteFrom('users'));
},
});

Changing the component

After the changes in the wrapper functions, the MirageJS server methods, and
the HTTP methods, we need to change the component to the new library that
was implemented.

In the following parts, we will change the component to match the new
library that was implemented.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will change the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these steps to do it:

1. Open the App.vue file in the src folder.
2. We need to import the new getTodos function as follows:

import {
getHttp,
postHttp,
patchHttp,
deleteHttp,
getTodos,
} from './http/fetchApi';









3. In the data property of the Vue object, we need to create a new property

called userTodo, with the default value of an empty array:

data: () => ({
response: undefined,
userData: '',
userId: undefined,
userTodo: [],
}),

4. In the methods property, we need to create a new method called getUserTodo
that receives the userId argument. This method will fetch the list of to-do
items of the user and will attribute the response to the userTodo property:

async getUserTodo(userId) {
this.userTodo = await getTodos(userId);
},

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will change the <template> section of the single file
component. Follow these steps to do it:

1. Open the App.vue file in the src folder.
2. At the bottom of the template, we need to create a new input HTML

element, with the v-model directive bound to the userId property:

<h1> Get User ToDos </h1>
<label for="userData">
User Id:
<input type="number" step="1" v-model="userId">
</label>

3. To fetch the list of items, we need to create a button with an event

listener bound on the click event with the @click directive, targeting the
getUserTodo, and passing the userId in the execution:

<button
style="margin: 20px;"
@click="getUserTodo(userId)"
>
Fetch Data
</button>

To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute


the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:



How it works...

When we create a new instance of axios, a new object is created, and new
configurations, headers, interceptors, and manipulators are defined. This
happens because axios declares the create functions as the same as new Class.
It's the same interface but different objects.

Using this possibility, we were able to create two connection drivers, one for
the local API and another for the JSONPlaceHolder API, which has a different
baseURL.

Because of MirageJS server integration, all the HTTP requests are
intercepted by MirageJS, so we needed to add a directive in the router
constructor that indicates the routes that MirageJS won't intercept.

Creating a request and response
interceptor for axios

Using axios as the main HTTP manipulator in our application allows us to
use request and response interceptors. Those are used to manipulate the data
before sending it to the server or when receiving the data, manipulating it
before sending it back to the JavaScript code.


The most common way an interceptor is used is in JWT token validation and
refreshing the requests that receive a specific error or API error
manipulation.

In this recipe, we will learn how to create a request interceptor to check the
POST, PATCH, and DELETE methods and a response error manipulator.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can use the Vue project with Vue CLI that we
made in the 'Creating different axios instances' recipe, or we can start a new
one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create http-project

The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the
project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue,
and the Spacebar to select an option. Choose the default option:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
❯ default (babel, eslint)
Manually select features

Creating the interceptor


In the following steps, we will create an axios interceptor that will work as a
middleware. Follow the instructions do it correctly:

1. Install the Sweet Alert package. To do this you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and
execute the following command:

> npm install --save sweetalert2

2. Create a new file called interceptors.js in the src/http folder and open it.

3. Then, we import the Sweet Alert package:

import Swal from 'sweetalert2';

4. We need to create a constant with an array of the POST methods that

will be intercepted:

const postMethods = ['post', 'patch'];

5. We need to create a function named requestInterceptor and export it. This

function will receive one argument, config, which is an axios
configuration object. We need to check whether the request method is
included in the array we created earlier and whether the data property of
the data body has an id property. If any of the checks didn't pass, we
will throw an Error, otherwise, we will return config:

export function requestInterceptor(config) {
if (
postMethods.includes(config.method.toLocaleLowerCase()) &&
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call('id', config.data.data) &&
!config.data.data.id)
{
throw new Error('You need to pass an ID for this request');
}

return config;
}

6. For the response interceptor, we need to create a new function called

responseInterceptor that returns the response, as we won't change anything
in this interceptor:

export function responseInterceptor(response) {
return response;



}

7. For catching the error, we need to create an errorInterceptor function,

which will be exported. This function receives an error as an argument
and will display a sweetalert2 alert error message and return a
Promise.reject with the error:

export function errorInterceptor(error) {
Swal.fire({
type: 'error',
title: 'Error!',
text: error.message,
});

return Promise.reject(error);
}

Adding the interceptors to the HTTP methods functions

In the following steps, we will add the axios interceptor to the HTTP method
functions. Follow these steps to do it correctly:

1. Open the baseFetch.js file in the src/http folder.
2. We need to import the three interceptors we just created:

import {
errorInterceptor,
requestInterceptor,
responseInterceptor,
} from './interceptors';

3. After the creation of the localApi instance, we declare the use of the

request and response interceptor:

localApi.interceptors
.request.use(requestInterceptor, errorInterceptor);

localApi.interceptors
.response.use(responseInterceptor, errorInterceptor);

4. After the creation of the jsonPlaceholderApi instance, we declare the use of

the request and response interceptor:

jsonPlaceholderApi.interceptors
.request.use(requestInterceptor, errorInterceptor);

jsonPlaceholderApi.interceptors
.response.use(responseInterceptor, errorInterceptor);





How it works...

Each request that axios do passes through each of any one of the interceptors
in the set. The same thing happens for the response. If any error is thrown on
the interceptor, it will automatically be passed to the error manipulator, so
the request won't be executed at all, or the response will be sent to the
JavaScript code as an error.

We checked each request that was done for the POST, PATCH, and DELETE
method to see if there was an id property in the body data. If there wasn't, we
threw an error to the user, saying that they need to pass an ID for the request.

Creating a CRUD interface with
Axios and Vuesax

When dealing with data, there is something that we will always need to do: a
CRUD process. Regardless of what kind of application you are developing, a
CRUD interface is needed in order to input and manipulate any data on the
server, the administrator panel, the backend of your application, or even the
client side.

Here, we will learn how to create a simple CRUD interface using the Vuesax
framework for the UI and axios for the HTTP request.

Getting ready


The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, use the Vue project with Vue CLI that we used in
the 'Creating a request and response interceptor for axios' recipe, or start a
new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create http-project

The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the
project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to continue,
and the Spacebar to select an option. Choose the default option:

Adding Vuesax to the application

In the following steps, we will cover how to add the Vuesax UI library to your
Vue application. Follow these instructions to do it correctly:

1. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell

(Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm install --save vuesax material-icons

2. Create a file called style.css in the src folder and open it.


3. Import the vuesax, material-icon, and Open Sans font stylesheets:

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?
family=Open+Sans:300,300i,400,400i,600,600i,700,700i,800,
800i&display=swap');
@import url('~vuesax/dist/vuesax.css');
@import url('~material-icons/iconfont/material-icons.css');

* {
font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}

4. Open the main.js file in the src folder.
5. Import the style.css file and Vuesax. After that, you need to inform Vue to

use Vuesax:

import './server/server';
import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import Vuesax from 'vuesax';
import './style.css';

Vue.use(Vuesax);

Vue.config.productionTip = false;

new Vue({
render: h => h(App),
}).$mount('#app');

Creating the component routing

We will continue the recipe in five parts: List, Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
Our application will be a dynamic component application, so we will create
five components, one for each part. Those components will be like our
pages.

First, we need to change App.vue to be our main route manager and create a
mixin for changing the component.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Open App.vue in the src folder.






2. Import each one of the components that will be created here:

import List from './components/list';
import Create from './components/create';
import View from './components/view';
import Update from './components/update';

3. In the data property, create two new values: componentIs with a default

value of 'list', and userId with a default value of 0:

data: () => ({
componentIs: 'list',
userId: 0,
}),

4. We need to add a new property to the Vue object, called provide. This
property will be a function, so the provided values to the components
can be reactive:

provide () {
const base = {};

Object.defineProperty(base, 'userId', {
enumerable: true,
get: () => Number(this.userId),
});

return base;
},

5. In the computed properties, we need to create a new property called

component. This will be a switch case that will return our component,
based on the componentIs property:

computed: {
component() {
switch (this.componentIs) {
case 'list':
return List;
case 'create':
return Create;
case 'view':
return View;
case 'edit':
return Update;
default:
return undefined;
}
}
},




6. Finally, in the methods, we need to create a changeComponent method that

will update the current component to a new one:

methods: {
changeComponent(payload) {
this.componentIs = payload.component;
this.userId = Number(payload.userId);
},
},

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. In the div#app HTML element, we need to add a vs-row component:

<div id="app">
<vs-row></vs-row>
</div>

2. In the vs-row component, we need to add a vs-col component with the

following attributes: vs-type defined as flex, vs-justify defined as left, vs-
align defined as left, and vs-w defined as 12:

<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="12">
</vs-col>

3. Finally, inside the vs-col component, we will add a dynamic component
that has an is attribute to the computed property component and point the
event listener at the "change-component" event that will execute the
changeComponent method:

<component
:is="component"
@change-component="changeComponent"
/>

Creating the route mixin


In this part, we will create the component mixin to be re-used in other
components. Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Create a new file called changeComponent.js in the src/mixin folder and open

it.

2. This mixin will have a method called changeComponent, which will emit
a 'change-component' event with the name of the new component that
needs to be rendered, and the userId:

export default {
methods: {
changeComponent(component, userId = 0) {
this.$emit('change-component', { component, userId });
},
}
}

Creating the list component

The list component will be the index component. It will list the users in the
application and have all the links for the other CRUD actions.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Create a new file called list.vue in the src/components folder and open it.
2. Import the getHttp and deleteHttp from fetchApi and the changeComponent

mixin:

import {
getHttp,
deleteHttp,
} from '../http/fetchApi';
import changeComponent from '../mixin/changeComponent';

3. In the component mixins property, we need to add the imported

changeComponent mixin:

mixins: [changeComponent],


4. In the data property of the component, we add a new property named

userList, with a default empty array:

data: () => ({
userList: [],
}),

5. For the methods, we create getAllUsers and deleteUsers methods. In the
getAllUsers method, we fetch the user lists and set the userList value as
the response from the getHttp function execution. The deleteUser method
will execute the deleteHttp function, and then execute the getAllUsers
method:

methods: {
async getAllUsers() {
const { data } = await getHttp(`${window.location.href}api/users`);
this.userList = data;
},
async deleteUser(id) {
await deleteHttp(`${window.location.href}api/users/${id}`);
await this.getAllUsers();
},
}

6. Lastly, we make the beforeMount life cycle hook asynchronous, calling the

getAllUsers method:

async beforeMount() {
await this.getAllUsers();
},

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Create a vs-card component with the style attribute defined as margin:

20px:

<vs-card
style="margin: 20px;"
>
</vs-card>

2. Inside the vs-card component, create a dynamic <template> named slot for

header, with an <h3> tag and your title:


<template slot="header">
<h3>
Users
</h3>
</template>

3. After that, create a vs-row component with a vs-col component inside of

it, with the following attributes: vs-type defined as flex, vs-justify defined
as left, vs-align defined as left, and vs-w defined as 12:

<vs-row>
<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="12">
</vs-col>
</vs-row>

4. Inside the vs-col component, we need to create a vs-table component.
This component will have the data attribute pointed to the userList
variable, and will have the search, stripe, and pagination attributes defined
as true. The max-items attribute will be defined as 10 and the style attribute
will have the value of width: 100%; padding: 20px;:

<vs-table
:data="userList"
search
stripe
pagination
max-items="10"
style="width: 100%; padding: 20px;"
></vs-table>

5. For the table header, we need to create a dynamic <template> named slot
thead, and create for each column a vs-th component with the sort-key
attribute defined as the respective object key property and the display as
the name you want:

<template slot="thead">
<vs-th sort-key="id">
#
</vs-th>
<vs-th sort-key="name">
Name
</vs-th>
<vs-th sort-key="email">
Email
</vs-th>
<vs-th sort-key="country">
Country
</vs-th>


<vs-th sort-key="phone">
Phone
</vs-th>
<vs-th sort-key="Birthday">
Birthday
</vs-th>
<vs-th>
Actions
</vs-th>
</template>

6. For the table body, we need to create a dynamic <template> with a slot-

scope attribute defined as the data property. Inside this <template> we need
to create a vs-tr component that will iterate the data property and have a
vs-td component for each column that you set on the head of the table.
Each vs-td component has a data property set to the respective column
data object property, and the content will be the same data rendered.
The final column that is the actions column will have three buttons, one
for Read, another for Update, and the last for Delete. The Read button
will have an event listener on the "click" event pointing to the
changeComponent, and the same goes for the Update button. The Delete
button "click" event listener will be pointing to the deleteUser method:

<template slot-scope="{data}">
<vs-tr :key="index" v-for="(tr, index) in data">
<vs-td :data="data[index].id">
{{data[index].id}}
</vs-td>
<vs-td :data="data[index].name">
{{data[index].name}}
</vs-td>
<vs-td :data="data[index].email">
<a :href="`mailto:${data[index].email}`">
{{data[index].email}}
</a>
</vs-td>
<vs-td :data="data[index].country">
{{data[index].country}}
</vs-td>
<vs-td :data="data[index].phone">
{{data[index].phone}}
</vs-td>
<vs-td :data="data[index].birthday">
{{data[index].birthday}}
</vs-td>
<vs-td :data="data[index].id">
<vs-button
color="primary"
type="filled"
icon="remove_red_eye"
size="small"
@click="changeComponent('view', data[index].id)"
/>
<vs-button


color="success"
type="filled"
icon="edit"
size="small"
@click="changeComponent('edit', data[index].id)"
/>
<vs-button
color="danger"
type="filled"
icon="delete"
size="small"
@click="deleteUser(data[index].id)"
/>
</vs-td>
</vs-tr>
</template>

7. Finally, in the card footer, we need to create a dynamic <template> named
slot for footer. Inside this <template> we will add a vs-row component with
the vs-justify attribute defined as flex-start and insert a vs-button with the
color attribute defined as primary, type defined as filled, icon defined as
fiber_new, and size defined as small. The @click event listener will target
the changeComponent method with the parameters 'create' and 0:

<template slot="footer">
<vs-row vs-justify="flex-start">
<vs-button
color="primary"
type="filled"
icon="fiber_new"
size="small"
@click="changeComponent('create', 0)"
>
Create User
</vs-button>
</vs-row>
</template>

Single file component <style> section

In this part, we will create the <style> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Create a declaration of margin to the vs-button component class:

<style scoped>
.vs-button {
margin-left: 5px;
}
</style>


2. To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and
execute the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:

Creating a generic user form component

In the following parts, we will create a generic user form component that
will be used by other components. This component is considered generic
because it is a component that can be used by anyone.


Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Create a new file called userForm.vue in the src/components folder and open

it.

2. In the props Vue property, create two new properties called value and
disabled, both being objects and having the three properties of type,
required, and default. For the value property, the type will be Object, required
will be false, and default will be a factory returning an object. For the
disabled property, the type will be Boolean, required will be false, and the
default will also be false:

props: {
value: {
type: Object,
required: false,
default: () => {
},
},
disabled: {
type: Boolean,
required: false,
default: false,
}
},

3. In the data property, we need to add a new value of tmpForm, with the

default value of an empty object:

data: () => ({
tmpForm: {},
}),

4. In the Vue watch property, we need to create the handler for the tmpForm

and the value. For the tmpForm watcher, we will add a handler function that
will emit an 'input' event on each change with the new value, and add
the deep property to true. Finally, on the value watcher, we will add a
handler function that will set the value of the tmpForm as the new value. We
also need to define the deep and immediate properties as true:

watch: {
tmpForm: {
handler(value) {
this.$emit('input', value);


},
deep: true,
},
value: {
handler(value) {
this.tmpForm = value;
},
deep: true,
immediate: true,
}
},

When using watchers, declaring the deep property makes the watcher checks for deep
changes on arrays or objects, and the immediate property executes the watcher as soon as
the component is created.

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. For the inputs wrapper, we need to create a vs-row component. Inside the

vs-row component, we will create each input for our user form:

<vs-row></vs-row>

2. For the name input, we need to create a vs-col component, with the

attributes of vs-type defined as 'flex', vs-justify defined as 'left', vs-align
defined as 'left', and vs-w defined as '6'. Inside of the vs-col component,
we need to create a vs-input component, with the v-model directive bound
to tmpForm.name, the attributes of disabled bound to the disabled props, label
defined as 'Name', placeholder defined as 'User Name', and class defined as
'inputMargin full-width':

<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="6">

'inputMargin full-width':

<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="6">
<vs-input
v-model="tmpForm.email"
:disabled="disabled"
label="Email"
placeholder="User Email"
class="inputMargin full-width"
/>
</vs-col>

4. For the country input, we need to create a vs-col component, with the

attributes of vs-type defined as 'flex', vs-justify defined as 'left', vs-align
defined as 'left', and vs-w defined as '6'. Inside of the vs-col component,
we need to create a vs-input component, with the v-model directive bound
to tmpForm.country, the disabled attributes bound to the disabled props, label
defined as 'Country', placeholder defined as 'User Country', and class
defined as 'inputMargin full-width':

<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="6">
<vs-input
v-model="tmpForm.country"
:disabled="disabled"
label="Country"
placeholder="User Country"
class="inputMargin full-width"
/>
</vs-col>

5. For the phone input, we need to create a vs-col component, with the

attributes of vs-type defined as 'flex', vs-justify defined as 'left', vs-align
defined as 'left', and vs-w defined as '6'. Inside of the vs-col component,
we need to create a vs-input component, with the v-model directive bound


to tmpForm.phone, the disabled attributes bound to the disabled props, label
defined as 'Phone', placeholder defined as 'User Phone', and class defined as
'inputMargin full-width':

<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="6">
<vs-input
v-model="tmpForm.phone"
:disabled="disabled"
label="Phone"
placeholder="User Phone"
class="inputMargin full-width"
/>
</vs-col>

6. For the birthday input, we need to create a vs-col component, with the

attributes of vs-type defined as 'flex', vs-justify defined as 'left', vs-align
defined as 'left', and vs-w defined as '6'. Inside of the vs-col component,
we need to create a vs-input component, with the v-model directive bound
to tmpForm.birthday, the disabled attributes bound to the disabled props, label
defined as 'Birthday', placeholder defined as 'User Birthday', and class
defined as 'inputMargin full-width':

<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="6">
<vs-input
v-model="tmpForm.birthday"
:disabled="disabled"
label="Birthday"
placeholder="User Birthday"
class="inputMargin full-width"
/>
</vs-col>

Single file component <style> section

In this part, we will create the <style> section of the single file component.

as 15px:


<style>
.inputMargin {
margin: 15px;
}
</style>

Creating the create user component

To start our process with user manipulation, we need to create an initial base
user form to be shared between the View, Create, and Update components.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Create a new file called create.vue in the src/components folder and open it.
2. Import the UserForm component, the changeComponent mixin, and postHttp

from fetchApi:

import UserForm from './userForm';
import changeComponent from '../mixin/changeComponent';
import { postHttp } from '../http/fetchApi';

3. It the data property, we will add a userData object with the name, email,
birthday, country, and phone properties all defined as empty strings:

data: () => ({
userData: {
name: '',
email: '',
birthday: '',
country: '',
phone: '',
},
}),

4. In the Vue mixins property, we need to add the changeComponent:

mixins: [changeComponent],

5. In the Vue components property, add the UserForm component:

components: {
UserForm,
},


6. In the methods property, we need to create the createUser method that will
use the data on the userData property and will create a new user on the
server and then redirect the user to the users lists:

async createUser() {
await postHttp(`${window.location.href}api/users`, {
data: {
...this.userData,
}
});
this.changeComponent('list', 0);
},
},

style="margin: 20px;"
>
</vs-card>

2. Inside the vs-card component, create a dynamic <template> named slot for

header, with an <h3> tag and your title:

<template slot="header">
<h3>

</h3>
</template>

3. After that, create a vs-row component with a vs-col component inside of
it, with the attributes of vs-type defined as flex, vs-justify defined as left,
vs-align defined as left, and vs-w defined as 12:

<vs-row>
<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"

vs-w="12">
</vs-col>
</vs-row>


4. Inside the vs-col component, we will add the user-form component with

the v-model directive bound to userData:

<user-form
v-model="userData"

/>

5. Finally, in the card footer, we need to create a dynamic <template> named
slot for footer. Inside this <template> we will add a vs-row component with
the vs-justify attribute defined as flex-start and insert two vs-button
components. The first will be for creating the user and will have the
attributes of color defined as success, type defined as filled, icon defined
as save, and size defined as small. The @click event listener will target the
createUser method and the second vs-button component will be for
canceling this action and returning to the users lists. It will have the
attributes of color defined as danger, type defined as filled, icon defined as
cancel, size defined as small, style defined as margin-left: 5px, and the

5. In the Vue inject property, we need to declare the 'userId' property:

inject: ['userId'],

6. In the Vue components property, add the UserForm component:

components: {
UserForm,
},


7. For the methods, we will create the getUserById method. This method will
fetch the user data by the current ID and set the userData value as the
response from the getHttp function execution:

methods: {
async getUserById() {
const { data } = await
getHttp(`${window.location.href}api/users/${this.userId}`);
this.userData = data;
},
}

8. In the beforeMount life cycle hook, we will make it asynchronous, calling

the getUserById method:

</h3>
</template>

3. After that, create a vs-row component with a vs-col component inside of
it, with the attributes of vs-type defined as flex, vs-justify defined as left,
vs-align defined as left, and vs-w defined as 12:


<vs-row>
<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="12">
</vs-col>
</vs-row>

4. Inside the vs-col component, we will add the UserForm component with
the v-model directive bound to userData and the disabled attribute set to
true:

<user-form
v-model="userData"
disabled
/>

5. Finally, in the card footer, we need to create a dynamic <template> named
slot for footer. Inside this <template> we will add a vs-row component with
the vs-justify attribute defined as flex-start and insert two vs-button
components. The first will be for canceling this action and returning to
the users lists. It will have the attributes of color defined as danger, type
defined as filled, icon defined as cancel, size defined as small, and
the@click event listener target to the changeComponent method with the 'list'
and 0 parameters. The second vs-button component will be for the editing
the user and will have the attributes of color defined as success, type
defined as filled, icon defined as save, size defined as small style defined
as margin-left: 5px, and the @click event listener target to the

@click="changeComponent('edit', userId)"
>


Edit User
</vs-button>
</vs-row>
</template>

To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute
the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:

Updating the user component

We just viewed the user data, and now we want to update it. We need to
make a new component that is almost the same as the view component but
has the method of updating the user and has the form enabled.

Single file component <script> section


In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Create a file named update.vue in the src/components folder and open it.
2. Import the UserForm component, the changeComponent mixin, and the getHttp

and patchHttp functions from fetchApi:

import UserForm from './userForm';
import changeComponent from '../mixin/changeComponent';
import {
getHttp,
patchHttp,
} from '../http/fetchApi';

3. In the data property, we will add a userData object, with the name, email,
birthday, country, and phone properties, all defined as empty strings:

data: () => ({
userData: {
name: '',
email: '',
birthday: '',
country: '',
phone: '',
},
}),

4. In the Vue mixins property, we need to add the changeComponent mixin:

mixins: [changeComponent],

5. In the Vue inject property, we need to declare the 'userId' property:

inject: ['userId'],

6. In the Vue components property, add the UserForm component:

components: {
UserForm,
},

7. For the methods, we will create two: getUserById and updateUser. The

getUserById method will fetch the user data by the current ID and set the
userData value as the response from the getHttp function execution, and
the updateUser will send the current userDate to the server via the patchHttp
function and redirect back to the users list:


methods: {
async getUserById() {
const { data } = await
getHttp(`${window.location.href}api/users/${this.userId}`);
this.userData = data;
},
async updateUser() {
await patchHttp
(`${window.location.href}api/users/${this.userData.id}`, {
data: {
...this.userData,
}
});
this.changeComponent('list', 0);
},
},

8. On the beforeMount life cycle hook, we will make it asynchronous, calling

the getUserById method:

async beforeMount() {
await this.getUserById();
},

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Create a vs-card component with the style attribute defined as margin:

20px:

<vs-card
style="margin: 20px;"
>
</vs-card>

2. Inside the vs-card component, create a dynamic <template> named slot for

header, with an <h3> tag and your title:

<template slot="header">
<h3>
Update User
</h3>
</template>

3. After that, create a vs-row component with a vs-col component inside of
it, with the attributes of vs-type defined as flex, vs-justify defined as left,
vs-align defined as left, and vs-w defined as 12:


<vs-row>
<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="12">
</vs-col>
</vs-row>

4. Inside the vs-col component, we will add the UserForm component with
the v-model directive bound to userData and the disabled attribute set to
true:

<user-form
v-model="userData"
disabled
/>

5. Finally, in the card footer, we need to create a dynamic <template> named
slot for footer. Inside <template>, we will add a vs-row component with the
vs-justify attribute defined as flex-start and insert two vs-button
components. The first will be for creating the user and will have the
attributes of color defined as success, type defined as filled, icon defined
as save, size defined as small, and the @click event listener target to the
updateUser method. The second vs-button component will be for canceling
this action and returning to the users lists. It will have the attributes of
color defined as danger, type defined as filled, icon defined as cancel, size
defined as small, style defined as margin-left: 5px, and the @click event
listener target to the changeComponent method with the 'list' and 0
parameters:

<template slot="footer">
<vs-row vs-justify="flex-start">
<vs-button
color="success"
type="filled"
icon="save"
size="small"
@click="updateUser"
>
Update User
</vs-button>
<vs-button
color="danger"
type="filled"
icon="cancel"
size="small"
style="margin-left: 5px"
@click="changeComponent('list', 0)"
>
Cancel


</vs-button>
</vs-row>
</template>

To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute
the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:

How it works...

The CRUD interface that we created works like a router application, with
three routes, the index or list, the view, and the edit route. Each route has its
own screen and components, with separated logic functions.

We created an abstract UserForm component that was used on the View and
Update components. This abstract component can be used in many other
components, as it does not require any base logic to work; it's like an input
but made of several inputs.


Using the provide/inject API of Vue, we were able to pass the userId to each
of the components in an observable way, which means that when the
variable is updated, the component receives the updated variable. This is not
achievable using the normal Vue API, so we had to use the
Object.defineProperty and use the provide property as a factory function to return
the final object.

Managing Routes with vue-router

One of the main parts of your application is router management. Here, it is
possible to bring together infinite component combinations in a single place.

A router is capable of coordinating component rendering and dictating where
the application should be, depending on the URL. There are many ways to
increase the customization of vue-router. You can add route guards to check
whether specific routes are navigatable by access level or fetch data before
entering the route to manage errors on your application.

In this chapter, you will learn how to create application routes, dynamic
routes, alias and credited routes, and nested router views. We'll also look at
how to manage errors, create router guards, and lazy load your pages.

In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:

Creating a simple route
Creating a programmatic navigation
Creating a dynamic router path
Creating a route alias
Creating a route redirect
Creating a nested router view
Creating a 404 error page
Creating an authentication middleware
Lazy loading your pages asynchronously

Technical requirements

In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue-CLI.

Attention Windows users: you need to install an npm package called windows-build-tools
to be able to install the following required packages. To do so, open the PowerShell as
an administrator and execute the following command:
> npm install -g windows-build-tools


To install Vue-CLI, you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global

Creating a simple route

In your application, you can create an infinite combination of routes that can
lead to any number of pages and components.

vue-router is the maintainer of this combination. We need to use this to set
instructions on how to create paths and lay down routes for our visitors.

In this recipe, we will learn how to create an initial route that will lead to a
different component.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To create a Vue-CLI project, follow these steps:

1. We need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create initial-routes


2. The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the

project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to
continue, and the Spacebar to select an option.

3. There are two methods for starting a new project. The default method is
a basic Babel and ESLint project without any plugins or configuration,
and the Manually mode, where you can select more modes, plugins,
linters, and options. We will go for Manually:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
default (babel, eslint)
❯ Manually select features

4. Now we are asked about the features that we will want on the project.

Those features are some Vue plugins such as Vuex or Vue Router (Vue-
Router), testers, linters, and more. Select Babel, Router, and Linter /
Formatter:

? Check the features needed for your project: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Babel
TypeScript
Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
❯ Router
Vuex
CSS Pre-processors
❯ Linter / Formatter
Unit Testing
E2E Testing

5. Now Vue-CLI will ask if you want to use the history mode on the route

management. We will choose Y (yes):

? Use history mode for router? (Requires proper server setup for
index fallback in production) (Y/n) y

6. Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatted. In our case,

we will select ESLint + Airbnb config:

? Pick a linter / formatter config: (Use arrow keys)
ESLint with error prevention only
❯ ESLint + Airbnb config
ESLint + Standard config
ESLint + Prettier

7. After the linting rules are set, we need to define when they are applied
to your code. They can be either applied on save or fixed on commit:


? Pick additional lint features: (Use arrow keys)
Lint on save
❯ Lint and fix on commit

8. After all those plugins, linters, and processors are defined, we need to

choose where the settings and configs are stored. The best place to store
them is in a dedicated file, but it is also possible to store them in the
package.json:

? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? (Use arrow
keys)
❯ In dedicated config files
In package.json

9. Now you can choose whether you want to make this selection a preset
for future projects, so you don't need to reselect everything again:

? Save this as a preset for future projects? (y/N) n

Our recipe will be divided into five parts:

Creating the NavigationBar component
Creating the contact page
Creating the about page
Changing the application's main component
Creating the routes

Let's get started.

Creating the NavigationBar component

Now we are going to create the NavigationBar component that will be used in
our application.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Create a navigationBar.vue file in the src/components folder and open it.


2. Create a default export object of the component, with the Vue

property name:

<script>
export default {
name: 'NavigationBar',
};
</script>

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Create a div HTML element with the id attribute defined as "nav", and

inside of it, create three RouterLink components. Those components will
point to the Home, About, and Contact routes. In the RouterLink component,
we will add a to attribute that will be defined as the route for each
component, respectively, and define the text content as the name of the
menu:

<div id="nav">
<router-link to="/">
Home
</router-link> |
<router-link to="/about">
About
</router-link> |
<router-link to="/contact">
Contact
</router-link>
</div>

Creating the contact page

We need to make sure the contact page gets rendered when the user enters
the /contact URL. To do so, we need to create a single file component to be
used as the contact page.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:


1. In the src/views folder, create a new file called contact.vue and open it.
2. Create a default export object of the component, with the Vue property

name:

<script>
export default {
name: 'ContactPage',
};
</script>

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Create a div HTML element, with the class attribute defined as "contact".
2. Inside of the <h1> HTML element, add a text context displaying the

current page:

<template>
<div class="contact">
<h1>This is a contact page</h1>
</div>
</template>

Creating the about page

We need to make the contact page be rendered when the user enters
the /about URL. In the following subsections, we will create the Single File
component for the about page.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. In the src/views folder, create a new file called About.vue and open it.
2. Create a default export object of the component, with the Vue

property name:

<script>
export default {


name: 'AboutPage',
};
</script>

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Create a div HTML element with the class attribute defined as "about" .
2. Inside of it, place an <h1> element with a text context displaying the

current page:

<template>
<div class="about">
<h1>This is an about page</h1>
</div>
</template>

Changing the application's main component

After creating the pages and the navigation bar, we need to change the
application's main component to be able to render the routes and have the
navigation bar at the top.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Open App.vue in the src folder.
2. Import the NavigationBar component:

import NavigationBar from './components/navigationBar.vue';

3. In the Vue components property, declare the imported NavigationBar:

export default {
components: { NavigationBar },
};

Single file component <template> section


In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Inside the div HTML element, add the NavigationBar component and the
RouterView component:

<template>
<div id="app">
<navigation-bar />
<router-view/>
</div>
</template>

Creating the routes

Now we need to make the routes available in the application. To do so, first,
we need to declare the routes and the components that the routes will render.
Follow these steps to create your Vue application router correctly:

1. In the src/router folder, open the index.js file.
2. Import the Contact component page:

import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
import Home from '../views/Home.vue';
import Contact from '../views/contact.vue';

3. In the routes array, we need to create a new route object. This object will
have the path property defined as '/contact', name defined as 'contact',
and component pointing to the imported Contact component:

{
path: '/contact',
name: 'contact',
component: Contact,
},

To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute
the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:


How it works...

When vue-router is added to Vue as a plugin, it starts to watch for changes on
window.location.pathname, and other URL properties, to check the weight of the
current URL on the browser against the list of URLs on your router
configurations.

In this particular case, we are using a direct URL and a non-dynamic URL.
Because of that, the vue-router plugin only needs to check direct matches of
the URL paths and doesn't need to weigh the possible matches against a
regex validator.

After a URL is matched, the router-view component acts as a dynamic
component and renders the component we defined on the vue-router
configuration.

Creating a programmatic
navigation

When using vue-router, it is also possible to change the current route of the
application through function execution, without the need for special vue-
router components for creating links.

Using programmatic navigation, you can make sure all the route redirections
can be executed anywhere in your code. Using this method enables the usage
of special route directions, such as passing parameters and navigation with
the route name.

In this recipe, we will learn how to execute a programmatic navigation
function, using the extra possibilities it provides.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we can use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we
created in the 'Creating a simple route' recipe, or we can start a new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create route-project


Choose the manual features and add the Router as a needed feature, as
indicated in the 'How to do it...' section in the 'Creating a simple route'
recipe.

Our recipe will be divided into two parts:

Changing the application's main component
Changing the contact view

Let's get started.

Changing the application's main component

We will start with the App.vue file. We will add a programmatic navigation
function to be executed after a timeout, which will be added to the
component life cycle hook.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Open App.vue in the src folder.
2. Add a mounted property:

mounted() {}

3. In the mounted property, we need to add a setTimeout function, which will
execute the $router.push function. When executed, this function receives
a JavaScript object as an argument, with two properties, name, and params:

mounted() {
setTimeout(() => {
this.$router.push({
name: 'contact',
params: {
name: 'Heitor Ribeiro',
age: 31,
},
});
}, 5000);
},


Changing the contact view

On the contact view, we need to add an event listener, which will grab the
route change and execute an action.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Open contact.vue in the src/views folder.
2. Add a new mounted property:

mounted() {}

3. In this property, we will add a verification that will check whether there
are any parameters on the $route.params object and display an alert with
that $route.params:

mounted() {
if (Object.keys(this.$route.params).length) {
alert(`Hey! I've got some parameter!
${JSON.stringify(this.$route.params)}`);
}
},

To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute
the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:


How it works...

The $router.push function, when executed, tells vue-router to change where the
application is, and in this process, you are passing down some parameters to
the new router that will replace the current route. In those parameters, there's
a property called params, which sends a group of parameters to the new router.

When entering this new router, all the parameters that we will have called
from within the router will be available in the $route.params object; there, we
can use it in our view or component.

There's more...

In the programmatic navigation, it's possible to navigate through the routers,
adding them to the browser history with the $router.push function, but there
are other functions that can be used too.


The $router.replace function will replace the user navigation history for a new
one, making it unable to go back to the last page.

$router.go is used to move the user navigation history in steps. To go forward,
you need to pass positive numbers and to go backward, you will need to pass
negative numbers.

ttps://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/navigation.html.

Creating a dynamic router path

Adding a route to your application is a must, but sometimes you need more
than just simple routes. In this recipe, we'll take a look at how dynamic
routes come into play. With dynamic routes, you can define custom variables
that can be set via the URL, and your application can start with those
variables already defined.

In this recipe, we will learn how to use a dynamic router path on a CRUD
list.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global


How to do it...

To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we
completed in the 'Creating a CRUD interface with axios and Vuesax' recipe
in Chapter 5, Fetching Data from the Web via HTTP Requests. In the
following steps, we will add vue-router to the project through the Vue UI
dashboard:

1. First, you will need to open vue ui. To do this, open Terminal (macOS or
Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the
following command:

> vue ui

2. There, you will need to import the project by locating the project folder.

After importing vue ui, you will be redirected to the dashboard.

3. Add vue-router to the plugins by going to the plugins management page

and clicking on the Add vue-router button. Then, click on
the Continue button.

4. The Vue-CLI will automatically install and configure vue-router on the
project for us. We now need to create each view for the List, View, and
Edit pages.

To start view development, we will go first by the user list route. In each
route, we will deconstruct the old component that we had made, and recreate
it as a view.

Our recipe will be divided into eight parts:

Changing the application's main component
Changing the route mixin
Axios instance configuration
User list view
User create view
User information view
User update view
Creating dynamic routes


Let's get started.

Changing the application's main component

After adding the vue-router plugin, App.vue will change. We need to revert the
changes made by the installation of the vue-router. This is needed because
when vue-ui adds the vue-router plugin, it will change App.vue, adding an
example code that we don't need.

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Open App.vue in the src folder.
2. Remove everything, leaving just the div#app HTML element and the

router-view component:

<template>
<div id="app">
<router-view/>
</div>
</template>

Changing the route mixin

In the previous recipe, we used a changeComponent mixin. Now that we are
going to work with routes, we need to change this mixin to a changeRoute
mixin and alter its behavior. In the following steps, we will change how the
mixin works, to be able to change the route instead of the component:

1. In the src/mixin folder, rename changeComponent.js to changeRoute.js and open

it.

2. We will remove the changeComponent method and create a new one called
changeRoute. This new method will receive two arguments, name and id.
The name argument is the route name, as set in the vue-router
configuration and the id will be the user id that we will pass a parameter


in the route change. This method will execute $router.push, passing those
arguments as the parameters:

export default {
methods: {
async changeRoute(name, id = 0) {
await this.$router.push({
name,
params: {
id,
},
});
},
}
}

Axios instance configuration

To fetch the data in the MirageJS server, we will need to define some options
in our axios instance. Now, in the following steps, we will configure the
axios instance to work with the new routering system:

1. In the src/http folder, open the baseFetch.js file.
2. At the creator of the localApi instance of axios, we will need to add an
options object, passing the baseURL property. This baseURL will be the
current browser navigation URL:

const localApi = createAxios({
baseURL: `${document.location.protocol}//${document.location.host}`,
});

User list view

To create our view, we will extract the code from the list.vue component and
reshape it as a page view.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Move the list.vue file from components to the views folder, and rename

it List.vue.


2. Remove the old changeComponent mixin import and import the new

changeRoute mixin:

import changeRouteMixin from '@/mixin/changeRoute';

3. At the Vue mixins property, we need to replace changeComponent

with changeRoute:

mixins: [changeRouteMixin],

4. In the getAllUsers and deleteUser methods, we need to

remove ${window.location.href} from the getHttp and deleteHttp function
parameters:

methods: {
async getAllUsers() {
const { data } = await getHttp(`api/users`);
this.userList = data;
},
async deleteUser(id) {
await deleteHttp(`api/users/${id}`);
await this.getAllUsers();
},
}

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. We need to wrap the VsCard component and its child contents with a VsRow

and VsCol component. The VsCol component will have the vs-type
attribute defined as 'flex', vs-justify defined as 'left', vs-align defined
as 'left', and vs-w defined as 12:

<template>
<vs-row>
<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="12">
<vs-card... />
</vs-col>
</vs-row>
</template>


2. On the actions buttons, we will change the changeComponent functions

to changeRoute:

<vs-td :data="data[index].id">
<vs-button
color="primary"
type="filled"
icon="remove_red_eye"
size="small"
@click="changeRoute('view', data[index].id)"
/>
<vs-button
color="success"
type="filled"
icon="edit"
size="small"
@click="changeRoute('edit', data[index].id)"
/>
<vs-button
color="danger"
type="filled"
icon="delete"
size="small"
@click="deleteUser(data[index].id)"
/>
</vs-td>

3. At the VsCard footer, we need to change the actions

buttons, changeComponent method to the changeRoute method:

<template slot="footer">
<vs-row vs-justify="flex-start">
<vs-button
color="primary"
type="filled"
icon="fiber_new"
size="small"
@click="changeRoute('create')"
>
Create User
</vs-button>
</vs-row>
</template>

User create view

To create our view, we will extract the code from the create.vue component
and reshape it as a page view.

Single file component <script> section


In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Move the create.vue file from components to the views folder, and rename

it Create.vue.

2. Remove the old changeComponent mixin import and import the

new changeRoute mixin:

import changeRouteMixin from '@/mixin/changeRoute';

3. At the Vue mixins property, we need to
replace changeComponent with changeRoute:

mixins: [changeRouteMixin],

4. On the getUserById method, we need to

remove ${window.location.href} from the postHttp function URL and
change the changeComponent functions to changeRoute:

async createUser() {
await postHttp(`/api/users`, {
data: {
...this.userData,
}
});
this.changeRoute('list');
},

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. We need to wrap the VsCard component and its child contents with
a VsRow and VsCol component. The VsCol component will have the vs-
type attribute defined as 'flex', vs-justify defined as 'left', vs-
align defined as 'left', and vs-w defined as 12:

<template>
<vs-row>
<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="12">


<vs-card... />
</vs-col>
</vs-row>
</template>

2. On the VsCard footer, we need to change the Cancel
button's changeComponent functions to changeRoute:

<vs-button
color="danger"
type="filled"
icon="cancel"
size="small"
style="margin-left: 5px"
@click="changeRoute('list')"
>
Cancel
</vs-button>

User information view

To create our view, we will extract the code from the view.vue component and
reshape it as a page view.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Move the view.vue file from src/components to the src/views folder and

rename it as View.vue.

2. Remove the old changeComponent mixin import and import the

new changeRoute mixin:

import changeRouteMixin from '@/mixin/changeRoute';

3. At the Vue mixins property, we need to
replace changeComponent with changeRoute:

mixins: [changeRouteMixin],

4. Create a new computed property in the component object, with the

property userId, which will return $route.params.id:


computed: {
userId() {
return this.$route.params.id;
},
},

5. On the getUserById method, we need to

remove ${window.location.href} from the getHttp function URL:

methods: {
async getUserById() {
const { data } = await getHttp(`api/users/${this.userId}`);
this.userData = data;
},
}

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. We need to wrap the VsCard component and its child contents with
a VsRow and VsCol component. The VsCol component will have the vs-
type attribute defined as 'flex', vs-justify defined as 'left', vs-
align defined as 'left', and vs-w defined as 12:

<template>
<vs-row>
<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="12">
<vs-card... />
</vs-col>
</vs-row>
</template>

2. On the VsCard footer, we need to change the back
button changeComponent functions to changeRoute:

<vs-button
color="primary"
type="filled"
icon="arrow_back"

User update view

To create our view, we will extract the code from the update.vue component
and reshape it as a page view.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Move the update.vue file from src/components to the src/views folder and

rename it Edit.vue.

2. Remove the old changeComponent mixin import and import the

new changeRoute mixin:

import changeRouteMixin from '@/mixin/changeRoute';

3. At the Vue mixins property, we need to
replace changeComponent with changeRoute:

mixins: [changeRouteMixin],

4. Create a new computed property in the component object, with the

userId property , which will return $route.params.id:

computed: {
userId() {
return this.$route.params.id;
},
},

5. On the getUserById and updateUser methods, we need to remove

${window.location.href} from the getHttp and patchHttp function URLs and
change the changeComponent functions to changeRoute:

methods: {
async getUserById() {
const { data } = await getHttp(`api/users/${this.userId}`);
this.userData = data;
},
async updateUser() {


await patchHttp(`api/users/${this.userData.id}`, {
data: {
...this.userData,
}
});
this.changeRoute('list');
},
},

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. We need to wrap the VsCard component and its child contents with
a VsRow and VsCol component. The VsCol component will have the vs-
type  attribute defined as 'flex', vs-justify defined as 'left', vs-
align defined as 'left', and vs-w defined as 12:

<template>
<vs-row>
<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="12">
<vs-card... />
</vs-col>
</vs-row>
</template>

2. On the VsCard footer, we need to change the Cancel button's change

Component functions to changeRoute:

<vs-button
color="danger"
type="filled"
icon="cancel"
size="small"
style="margin-left: 5px"
@click="changeRoute('list')"
>
Cancel
</vs-button>

Creating dynamic routes

Now, with our page views created, we need to create our routes and make
them accept parameters, transforming them into dynamic routes. In the


following steps, we will create the dynamic routes of the application:

1. Open index.js in the src/router folder.
2. First, we need to import the four new pages – List, View, Edit, Create, and

Update:

import List from '@/views/List.vue';
import View from '@/views/View.vue';
import Edit from '@/views/Edit.vue';
import Create from '@/views/Create.vue';

3. On the routes array, we will add a new route object for each one of the
pages that were imported. In this object, there will be three properties:
name, path, and component.

4. For the list route, we will define name as 'list', path as '/',

and component as the imported List component:

{
path: '/',
name: 'list',
component: List,
},

5. On the view route, we will

define name as 'view', path as '/view/:id', and component as the
imported View component:

{
path: '/view/:id',
name: 'view',
component: View,
},

6. In the edit route, we will define name as 'edit', path as '/edit/:id',

and component as the imported Edit component:

{
path: '/edit/:id',
name: 'edit',
component: Edit,
},

7. Finally, at the create route, we will

define name as 'create', path as '/create', and component as the
imported Create component:


{
path: '/create',
name: 'create',
component: Create,
},

8. When the VueRouter is created, we will add the mode options property and

set it as 'history':

const router = new VueRouter({
mode: 'history',
base: process.env.BASE_URL,
routes
});

To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute
the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:

List View Route - / will be your user list page, containing a list of all
the users in your application and buttons to view, edit, and delete it, as
well as a button to create a new user:


User View Route - /view/:id will be your user view page, where it's
possible to view your user information, such as the user's name, email,
country, birthday, and phone number:


User Edit Route - /update/:id will be your user edit page, where it's
possible to edit your user's information, changing the user's name,
email, country, birthday, and phone number:


Create User Route - /update/:id will be your user creation page, where
it's possible to create a new user on the system:


How it works...

When vue-router is created, and the route is passed for matching, the router
analysis check for the best match for the route based on a RegEx for defining
a weight on each route.


When a route is defined and has a variable in its path, you need to add
a : before the variable parameter. This parameter is passed down to the
component in the $route.params property.

Creating a route alias

Every application is a living organism – it evolves, mutates, and changes day
by day. Sometimes these evolutions can come through the form of a router
change, for better naming or for a deprecated service. In vue-router, it's
possible to make all those changes invisible to the user, so when they use old
links, they still can access the application.

In this recipe, we will learn how to create a route alias for our application
and use it.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...


To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we
completed in the 'Creating a dynamic router path' recipe, or we can start a
new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create http-project

Choose the manual features and add router as a required feature, as indicated
in the 'How to do it...' section of the 'Creating a simple route' recipe.

Now, in the following steps, we will create the router alias:

1. Open index.js in the src/router folder.
2. At the list object, we will change the path property from '/' to '/user'

and for the alias property, we will set '/':

{
path: '/user',
name: 'list',
alias: '/',
component: List,
},

3. In the view object, we will change the path property

from '/view/:id' to '/user/:id' and we will set the alias property
to '/view/:id':

{
path: '/user/:id',
name: 'view',
alias: '/view/:id',
component: View,
},

4. In the edit object, we will change the path property

from '/edit/:id' to '/user/edit/:id' and set the alias property
to '/edit/:id':

{
path: '/user/edit/:id',
name: 'edit',
alias: '/edit/:id',
component: Edit,
},


5. Finally, in the create object, we will change the path property

from '/create' to '/user/create' and set the alias property to '/create':

{
path: '/user/create',
name: 'create',
alias: '/create',
component: Create,
},

How it works...

When the user enters your application, vue-router will try to match paths to
the one that the user is trying to access. If there is a property called alias in
the route object, this property will be used by the vue-router to maintain the
old route under the hood and use the alias route instead. If an alias is found,
the component of that alias is rendered, and the router remains as the alias,
not showing the user the change, making it transparent.

In our scenario, we made a transformation for our application to now handle
all the users called on the /user namespace, but still maintaining the old URL
structure so that if an old visitor tries to access the website, they will be able
to use the application normally.

s.org/guide/essentials/redirect-and-alias.html#alias.

Creating route redirects

Router redirect works almost the same as the router alias, but the main
difference is that the user is truly redirected to the new URL. Using this
process, you are able to manage how the new route can be loaded.

Getting ready


The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we
completed in the 'Creating a route alias' recipe, or we can start a new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create http-project

Choose the manual features and add Router as a required feature, as indicated
in the 'How to do it...' steps in the 'Creating a simple route' recipe.

Now, in these steps, we will create the router redirect rules:

1. Open index.js in the src/router folder.
2. Insert a new route object at the end of the routes array. This object will
have two properties, path and redirect. In the path property, we need to
define the path that the user will enter, '/create-new-user', and in redirect,
the path that the user will be redirected to, in this case, '/user/create':

{
path: '/create-new-user',
redirect: '/user/create',
},

3. Create a new object, and this object will have two

properties, path and redirect. In the path property, we need to define the
path that the user will enter, '/users', and in the redirect, we will create
an object with a property called name and will put the value as 'list':


{
path: '/users',
redirect: {
name: 'list',
},
},

4. Create a new object. This object will have two

properties, path and redirect. In the path property, we need to define the
path that the user will enter, '/my-user/:id?', and in the redirect, we will
create a function, which will receive an argument, to, which is an object
of the current route. We need to check whether the user ID is present in
the route, to redirect the user to the edit page. Otherwise, we will
redirect them to the user list:

{
path: '/my-user/:id?',
redirect(to) {
if (to.params.id) {
return '/user/:id';
}
return '/user';
},
},

5. Finally, in the end, we will create a route object with two

properties, path and redirect. In the path property, we need to define the
path that the user will enter, '/*', and in the redirect, we need to define
the redirect property as '/':

{
path: '*',
redirect: '/',
},

Remember that the last route with the '*' will always be the route that will be rendered
when there is no match in the URL that your user is trying to enter.

How it works...

As we define redirect as a new route, it works similar to the alias, but the
redirect property can receive three types of arguments: a string when
redirecting for the route itself, objects when redirecting with other
parameters such as the name of the route, and last but not least, the function
type, which redirect can handle and return one of the first two objects so the
user can be redirected.

Creating a nested router view

In vue-router, nested routes are like a namespace for your routes, where you
can have multiple levels of routes inside the same route, use a base view as
the main view, and have the nested routes rendered inside.

In a multi-module application, this is used to handle routes like CRUD,
where you will have a base route, and the children will be the CRUD views.

In this recipe, you will learn how to create a nested route.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we
used in the 'Creating a dynamic router path' recipe, or we can start a new
one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:


> vue create http-project

Choose the manual features and add Router as a required feature, as indicated
in the 'How to do it...' section in the 'Creating a simple route' recipe.

Our recipe will be divided into two parts:

Creating the router-view on the layout
Changing the router files

Let's get started.

Creating the router-view on the layout

When using vue-router with children's routes, we need to create the main
view, which will have a special component called RouterView. This component
will render the current router inside the layout or page you are rendering.

Now, in the following steps, we will create the layout for the pages:

1. In the src/views folder, we need to create a new folder called user and

move the Create, Edit, List, and View pages to this new folder.
2. Create a new file called Index.vue in the user folder and open it.
3. In the single file component <template> section, add a router-

view component:

<template>
<router-view/>
</template>
<script>
export default {
name: 'User',
}
</script>

Changing the router files

We will create a new file that will manage the user's specific routes, which
will help us to maintain the code and make it cleaner.

User routes


In the following steps, we will create routes for the user:

1. Create a new file called user.js in the src/router folder.
2. Import the Index, List, View, Edit, and Create views:

import Index from '@/views/user/Index.vue';
import List from '@/views/user/List.vue';
import View from '@/views/user/View.vue';
import Edit from '@/views/user/Edit.vue';
import Create from '@/views/user/Create.vue';

3. Create an array and make it the default export of the file. In this array,

add a route object, with four properties – path, name, component, and children.
Set the path property as '/user', define the name property as 'user',
define component as the imported Index component, and finally, define the
children property as an empty array:

export default [
{
path: '/user',
name: 'user',
component: Index,
children: [],
},
]

4. In the children property, add a new route object with three properties –
path, name, and component. Define path as '', name as 'list', and finally,
define the component property as the imported List component:

{
path: '',
name: 'list',
component: List,
},

5. Create a route object for the view route and use the same structure as
the last route object. Define the path property as ':id', define name as
'view', and define component as the imported View component:

{
path: ':id',
name: 'view',
component: View,
},

6. Create a route object for the edit route and use the same structure as the

last route object. Define the path property as 'edit/:id',


define name as 'edit', and define component as the
imported Edit component:

{
path: 'edit/:id',
name: 'edit',
component: Edit,
},

7. Create a route object for the create route, using the same structure as the

last route object. Define the path property as 'create',
define name as 'create' , and define component as the
imported Create component:

{
path: 'create',
name: 'create',
component: Create,
},

Router manager

In the following steps, we will create the router manager that will control all
the routes on the application:

1. Open the index.js in the src/router folder.
2. Import the newly created user.js file in the src/router folder:

import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
import UserRoutes from './user';

3. In the routes array, add the imported UserRoutes as a destructed array:

const routes = [
...UserRoutes,
{
path: '*',
redirect: '/user',
},
];

How it works...


vue-router provides the ability to use child routes as internal components of a
current view or layout. This gives the possibility to create an initial route
with a special layout file, and render the child component inside this layout
through the RouterView component.

This technique is commonly used for defining a layout in an application and
setting a namespace for the modules where the parent route can have a set of
specific orders that will be available for every one of its children.

Creating a 404 error page

There will be some occasions when your user may try to enter an old link or
enter a typo and won't get to the correct route, and this should lead
them directly to a not found error.

In this recipe, you will learn how to handle a 404 error in vue-router.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...


To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we
used in the 'Creating a nested router view' recipe, or we can start a new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create http-project

Choose the manual features and add Router as a required feature, as indicated
in the 'How to do it...' section in the 'Creating a simple route' recipe.

Our recipe will be divided into two parts:

Creating the NotFound view
Changing the router files

Let's get started.

Creating the NotFound view

We need to create a new view to be displayed for the user when there is no
matching route on the application. This page will be a simple, generic page.

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. In the src/views folder, create a new file called NotFound.vue and open it.

2. Create a VsRow component and inside of it create four VsCol components.

All of those components will have the attribute vs-w defined
as 12 and class as text-center:

<vs-row>
<vs-col vs-w="12" class="text-center">
<!-- Icon -->
</vs-col>
<vs-col vs-w="12" class="text-center">
<!-- Title -->
</vs-col>


<vs-col vs-w="12" class="text-center">
<!-- Text -->
</vs-col>
<vs-col vs-w="12" class="text-center">
<!-- Button -->
</vs-col>
</vs-row>

3. On the first VsCol component, we will add a VsIcon component, and set
the attribute icon as sentiment_dissatisfied and define the size as large:

<vs-icon
icon="sentiment_dissatisfied"
size="large"
/>

4. In the second VsCol component, we will add a title for the page:

<h1>Oops!</h1>

5. In the third VsCol component, we need to create the text that will be

placed on the page:

<h3>The page you are looking for are not here anymore...</h3>

6. Finally, on the fourth VsCol component, we will add the VsButton

component. This button will have the attribute type defined as relief and
to defined as '/':

<vs-button
type="relief"
to="/"
>
Back to Home...
</vs-button>

Single file component <style> section

In this part, we will create the <style> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Add the scoped tag to the <style> tag:

<style scoped>
</style>


2. Create a new rule named .text-center, with the text-align property

defined as center and margin-bottom defined as 20px;:

.text-center {
text-align: center;
margin-bottom: 20px;
}

Changing the router files

After we have created the view, we need to add it to the router and make it
available to the user. To do it, we will need to add the view route into the
router manager.

In these steps, we will change the router manager, to add the new error page:

1. Open index.js in the src/router folder.
2. Import the NotFound component:

import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
import UserRoutes from './user';
import NotFound from '@/views/NotFound';

3. In the routes array, after UserRoutes, add a new route object with two
properties, path and redirect. Define the path property as '/' and the
redirect property as '/user':

{
path: '/',
redirect: '/user'
},

4. For the not found page, we need to create a new route object that needs
to be placed in the last position in the routes array. This route object will
have two properties, path, and component. The path property will be
defined as '*' and component as the imported NotFound view:

{
path: '*',
component: NotFound,
},

To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute


the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:

How it works...

vue-router tries to find the best match for the URL that the user wants to
access; if there isn't a match, vue-router will use the '*' path as the default
value for these scenarios, where the * represents any value that the user has
entered that is not in the router lists.

Because the process of matching in vue-router is determined by the weight of
the route, we need to place the error page at the very bottom, so vue-router
needs to pass in every possible route before actually calling the NotFound
route.

history mode at https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#caveat.


Creating and applying
authentication middleware

In vue-router, it's possible to create router guards – functions that run each
time a router is changed. Those guards are used as middleware in the router
management process. It's common to use them as an authentication
middleware or session validators.

In this recipe, we will learn how to create authentication middleware, add
metadata to our routes to make them restricted, and create a login page.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we
used in the 'Creating a 404 error page' recipe, or we can start a new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create http-project

Choose the manual features and add Router as a required feature, as indicated
in the 'How to do it...' section in the 'Creating a simple route' recipe.


Our recipe will be divided into three parts:

Creating the authentication middleware
Adding the metadata and the middleware to the router
Attaching the middleware to vue-router and creating the login page

Let's get started.

Creating the login view

The login view will be the page that the user will see if they are not
authenticated. We will construct a simple page with two inputs inside – a
card and a button.

Single file component <script> section

In this part, we will create the <script> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. In the src/views folder, create a new file called Login.vue and open it.
2. Create a data property, containing username, password, and error:

data: () => ({
username: '',
password: '',
error: false,
}),

3. Then create the methods property with a method called userSignIn. This
method will validate if the username and password data are complete. If it
is, it will create a new key called 'auth' in sessionStorage, with encrypted
stringified JSON of the username data. Then, set error to false and
execute $router.replace to redirect the user to the user list '/user'. If any
of the fields do not pass in any of the validations, the method will
define the error as true and return false:

methods: {
userSignIn() {
if (this.username && this.password) {
window.sessionStorage.setItem('auth',
window.btoa(JSON.stringify({
username: this.username


})
)
);
this.error = false;
this.$router.replace('/user');
}
this.error = true;
return false;
},
}

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we will create the <template> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. Create a div.container HTML element with a VsRow component inside.

The VsRow component will have the attribute vs-align defined as "center"
and vs-justify defined as "center":

<div class="container">
<vs-row
vs-align="center"
vs-justify="center"
>
</vs-row>
</div>

2. Inside the VsRow component, add a VsCol component with the attribute vs-
lg defined as 4, vs-sm defined as 6, and vs-xs defined as 10. Then, inside
the VsCol component, we will create a VsCard component with the style
attribute defined as margin: 20px;:

<vs-col
vs-lg="4"
vs-sm="6"
vs-xs="10"
>
<vs-card
style="margin: 20px;"
>
</vs-card>
</vs-col>

3. Inside the VsCard component, create a dynamic <template> with the slot

named  header, an h3 HTML element, and your title:

<template slot="header">
<h3>
User Login


</h3>
</template>

4. After that, create a VsRow component with the attribute vs-align defined
as "center", vs-justify defined as "center", and two VsCol components
inside of it, with the attribute vs-w defined as 12:

<vs-row
vs-align="center"
vs-justify="center"
>
<vs-col vs-w="12">
</vs-col>
<vs-col vs-w="12">
</vs-col>
</vs-row>

5. On the first VsCol component, we will add a VsInput component, with the
attribute danger defined as the data error value, danger-text defined as the
text that will display on error, label defined as "Username",
placeholder defined as "Username or e-mail", and the v-model directive bound
to username:

<vs-input
:danger="error"
danger-text="Check your username or email"
label="Username"
placeholder="Username or e-mail"
v-model="username"
/>

6. In the second VsCol component, we will add a VsInput component, with

the attribute danger defined as the data error value, danger-text defined as
the text that will display on error, label defined as "Password", type defined
as password, placeholder defined as "Your password", and the v-model directive
bound to password:

<vs-input
:danger="error"
label="Password"
type="password"
danger-text="Check your password"
placeholder="Your password"
v-model="password"
/>

7. Finally, in the card footer, we need to create a dynamic <template> with

the slot named footer. Inside this <template>, we will add
a VsRow component with the vs-justify attribute defined as flex-start and


insert a VsButton with the attribute color defined as success, type defined
as filled, icon defined as account_circle, size defined as small and
the @click event listener targeted to the userSignIn method:

<template slot="footer">
<vs-row vs-justify="flex-start">
<vs-button
color="success"
type="filled"
icon="account_circle"
size="small"
@click="userSignIn"
>
Sign-in
</vs-button>
</vs-row>
</template>

Single file component <style> section

In this part, we will create the <style> section of the single file component.
Follow these instructions to create the component correctly:

1. First, we need to make this section scoped, so the CSS rules won't

affect any other component of the application:

<style scoped></style>

2. Then, we need to add the rules for the container class and

the VsInput component:

<style scoped>
.container {
height: 100vh;
display: flex;
flex-wrap: wrap;
justify-content: center;
align-content: center;
}

.vs-input {
margin: 5px;
}
</style>

To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute
the following command:



> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:

Creating the middleware

All vue-router middleware can also be referred to as navigation guards, and
they can be attached to the application route changes. Those changes have
some hooks that you can apply to your middleware. The authentication
middleware takes place before the router changes, so we can handle
everything and send the user to the correct route.

1. In the src/router folder, create a new folder called middleware, then create

and open a new file called authentication.js.

2. In this file, we will create a default export function that will have three
function parameters – to, from, and next. The to and from parameters are
objects, and the next parameter is a callback function:


export default (to, from, next) => {
};

3. We need to check whether the route that we are being redirected to has

an authenticated meta property set to true and whether we have a
sessionStorage item with the 'auth' key. If we pass those validations, we
can execute the next callback:

if (to.meta.authenticated && sessionStorage.getItem('auth')) {
return next();
}

4. Then, if the first validation didn't pass, we need to check whether the

router that we are redirecting the user to has the authenticated
meta property and check whether it's a false value. If the validation did
pass, we will execute the next callback:

if (!to.meta.authenticated) {
return next();
}

5. Finally, if none of our validations pass, execute the next callback,

passing '/login' as an argument:

next('/login');

Adding the metadata and the middleware to the router

After creating our middleware, we need to define which routes will be
authenticated and which routes won't. Then we have to import the
middleware to the router and define it when it is executed:

1. Open user.js in the src/router folder.
2. In each route object, add a new property called meta. This property will
be an object with an authenticated key and a value defined as true. We
need to do this to every route – even the children's routes:

import Index from '@/views/user/Index.vue';
import List from '@/views/user/List.vue';
import View from '@/views/user/View.vue';
import Edit from '@/views/user/Edit.vue';
import Create from '@/views/user/Create.vue';

export default [
{



path: '/user',
name: 'user',
component: Index,
meta: {
authenticated: true,
},
children: [
{
path: '',
name: 'list',
component: List,
meta: {
authenticated: true,
},
},
{
path: ':id',
name: 'view',
component: View,
meta: {
authenticated: true,
},
},
{
path: 'edit/:id',
name: 'edit',
component: Edit,
meta: {
authenticated: true,
},
},
{
path: 'create',
name: 'create',
component: Create,
meta: {
authenticated: true,
},
},
],
},
]

3. Open index.js in the src/router folder.
4. Import the newly created middleware and the Login view component:

import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
import UserRoutes from './user';
import NotFound from '@/views/NotFound';
import Login from '@/views/Login';
import AuthenticationMiddleware from './middleware/authentication';

5. Create a new route object for the login page view. This route object will
have path set to '/login', name defined as 'login', component defined as Login,
and the meta property will have the authenticated key with the value set
to false:


{
path: '/login',
name: 'login',
component: Login,
meta: {
authenticated: false,
},
},

6. On the error handling route, we'll define the

meta property authenticated as false because the login view is a public
route:

{
path: '*',
component: NotFound,
meta: {
authenticated: false,
},
},

7. Finally, after the creation of the router constructor, we need to inject the

middleware in the beforeEach execution:

router.beforeEach(AuthenticationMiddleware);

How it works...

Router guards work as middleware; they have a hook that is executed in
each life cycle of the vue-router process. For the purposes of this recipe, we
chose the beforeEach hook to add our middleware.

In this hook, we checked whether the user was authenticated and whether the
user needed authentication to navigate the route or not. After checking these
variables, we continued the process by sending the user to the route they
needed.

Lazy loading your pages
asynchronously

Components can be loaded when needed, and so can routes. Using lazy
loading techniques with vue-router allows more code-splitting and smaller
final bundles in your application.

In this recipe, we will learn how to transform routes in order to load them
asynchronously.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we
used in the 'Creating an authentication middleware' recipe, or we can start a
new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create http-project

Choose the manual features and add Router as a required feature, as indicated
in the 'How to do it...' section in the 'Creating a simple route' recipe.


Our recipe will be divided into two parts:

Updating the router manager
Updating the user routes

Let's get started.

Updating the router manager

To update the router manager, follow these instructions:

1. Open the index.js file in the src/router folder.
2. In each route that has a component property, we will transform the direct
attribution of the component to a new function. This will be an arrow
function returning the import() method of webpack:

{
path: '/login',
name: 'login',
component: () => import('@/views/Login'),
meta: {
authenticated: false,
},
},

3. Repeat the process on each one of the route objects that has a component

property.

Updating the user routes

To update the user routes, follow these instructions:

1. Open the user.js file in the src/router folder.
2. In each route that has a component property, we will transform the direct
attribution of the component to a new function. This will be an arrow
function returning the import() method of webpack:

{
path: '/user',
name: 'user',
component: () => import('@/views/user/Index.vue'),



meta: {
authenticated: true,
},
children: [],
},

3. Repeat the process on each one of the route objects that has

a component property.

How it works...

In ECMAScript, export and import are objects with predefined values when we
use the export default method. This means that when we import a new
component, this component is already being pointed to the default export of
that file.

To carry out the lazy loading process, we need to pass a function that will be
executed at runtime, and the return of that function will be the part of the
code that webpack divides in the bundling process.

When we call this function in vue-router, instead of the direct component
import, vue-router does a validation check that the present component import
is a function and needs to be executed. After the execution of the function,
the response is used as the component that will be displayed on the user's
screen.

Because the webpack import() method is asynchronous, this process can
happen alongside other code execution, without tempering or blocking the
main thread of the JavaScript VM.

Managing the Application State with
Vuex

Transferring data between sibling components can be very easy, but imagine
making a tree of components react to any data change. You will need to
trigger an event in an event bus or send the event through all the parent
components until it reaches over the top of the event chain and then gets sent
all the way down to the desired component; this process can be very tedious
and painful. If you are developing a large-scale application, this process is
not sustainable.

Flux libraries were developed to help with this process, with the idea of
bringing the reactivity outside of the component bounds, as Vuex is capable
of maintaining one single source of truth of your data and, at the same time,
is the place for you to have your business rules.

In this chapter, we will learn how to use Vuex, develop our store, apply it to
our components, and namespace it so we can have different modules of Vuex
inside the same store.

In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:

Creating a simple Vuex store
Creating and understanding the Vuex state
Creating and understanding the Vuex mutations
Creating and understanding the Vuex actions
Creating and understanding the Vuex getters
Creating a dynamic component with Vuex
Adding hot module reload for development
Creating a Vuex module

Technical requirements

In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue-CLI.


Attention, Windows users, you need to install an NPM package called windows-build-tools,
to be able to install the following required packages. To do it, open PowerShell as
administrator and execute the following command:
> npm install -g windows-build-tools

To install Vue-CLI, you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global

Creating a simple Vuex store

Creating a single source of truth in your application gives you the power to
simplify the flow of your data, enabling the reactivity of the data to flow into
another perspective, where you are not tied to a parent-child relationship
anymore. The data can now be stored in a single place and everyone can
fetch or request data.

In this recipe, we will learn how to install the Vuex library and create our
first single store, and how we can manipulate it with reactive actions and
data getters.

Getting ready

The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To create a Vue-CLI project, follow these steps:


1. We need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create initial-vuex

2. The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the

project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to
continue, and the Spacebar to select an option.

3. There are two methods for starting a new project. The default method is
a basic babel and eslint project without any plugin or configuration, and
the Manually mode, where you can select more modes, plugins, linters,
and options. We will go for Manually:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
default (babel, eslint)
❯ Manually select features

4. Now we are asked about the features that we will want in the project.
Those features are some Vue plugins such as Vuex or Router (Vue-
Router), testers, linters, and more. Select Babel, Router, Vuex, and Linter /
Formatter:

? Check the features needed for your project: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Babel
TypeScript
Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
❯ Router
❯ Vuex
CSS Pre-processors
❯ Linter / Formatter
Unit Testing
E2E Testing

5. Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatter. In our case, we

will select the ESLint + Airbnb config:

? Pick a linter / formatter config: (Use arrow keys)
ESLint with error prevention only
❯ ESLint + Airbnb config
ESLint + Standard config
ESLint + Prettier

6. After the linting rules are set, we need to define when they are applied

to your code. They can be either applied on save or fixed on commit:


? Pick additional lint features: (Use arrow keys)
Lint on save
❯ Lint and fix on commit

7. After all those plugins, linters, and processors are defined, we need to

choose where the settings and configs are stored. The best place to store
them is on a dedicated file, but it is also possible to store them in the
package.json file:

? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? (Use
arrow keys)
❯ In dedicated config files
In package.json

8. Now you can choose if you want to make this selection a preset for

future projects, so you don't need to reselect everything again:

? Save this as a preset for future projects? (y/N) n

Our recipe will be divided into two parts:

Creating the store
Creating the reactive component with Vuex

Let's get started.

Creating the store

Now you have the project with the Vuex library, and we need to create our
first store. In the following steps, we will create the Vuex store:

1. Open the index.js from the src/store folder.
2. In the state property, add a new key called counter and set the value to 0:

state: {
counter: 0,
},

3. In the mutations property, add two new functions, increment and decrement.
Both of the functions will have a state argument, which is the current
Vuex state object. The increment function will increment the counter by 1
and the decrement function will decrement the counter by 1:


mutations: {
increment: (state) => {
state.counter += 1;
},
decrement: (state) => {
state.counter -= 1;
},
},

4. Finally, in the actions property, add two new

functions, increment and decrement. Both of the functions will have a
deconstructed argument, commit, which is a function to call the Vuex
mutation. In each function, we will execute the commit function, passing
as a parameter the name of the current function as a string:

actions: {
increment({ commit }) {
commit('increment');
},
decrement({ commit }) {
commit('decrement');
},
},

Creating the reactive component with Vuex

Now that you have your Vuex store defined, you need to interact with it. We
will create a reactive component that will display the current state counter on
the screen, and show two buttons, one for incrementing the counter, and
another for decrementing the counter.

Single file component <script> section

Here we are going to write the <script> section of the single file component:

1. Open the App.vue file from the src folder.
2. Create the <script> section in the file, with an export default object:

<script>
export default {};
</script>

3. In the newly created object, add the Vue computed property with a

property called counter. In this property we need to return the current
$store.state.counter:


computed: {
counter() {
return this.$store.state.counter;
},
},

4. Finally, create a Vue methods property with two functions, increment and
decrement. Both of the functions will execute a $store.dispatch with a
parameter being the function name as a string:

methods: {
increment() {
this.$store.dispatch('increment');
},
decrement() {
this.$store.dispatch('decrement');
},
},

Single file component <template> section

Let's code the <template> section of the single file component:

1. Open the App.vue file in the src folder.
2. In the <template> section, remove everything inside the div#app.
3. Create an h1 HTML element with the counter variable inside of it.
4. Create a button with an event listener on the @click directive that calls

the increment function, and have + as a label:

<button @click="increment">+</button>

5. Create a button with an event listener on the @click directive that calls

the decrement function, and - as a label:

<button @click="decrement">-</button>

To run the server and see your component, you need to open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and
execute the following command:

> npm run serve

Here is your component rendered and running:


How it works...

When you declare your Vuex store, you need to create three main properties,
state, mutations, and actions. Those properties act as a single structure,
bounded to the Vue application through the $store injected prototype or the
exported store variable.

A state is a centralized object that holds your information and makes it
available to be used by the mutation, actions, or the components. Changing the
state always requires a synchronous function executed through a mutation.

A mutation is a synchronous function that can change the state and is
traceable, so when developing, you can time travel through all the executed
mutations in the Vuex store.

An action is an asynchronous function, which can be used to hold business
logic, API calls, dispatch other actions, and execute mutations. Those functions
are the common entrance point of any change in a Vuex store.

A simple representation of a Vuex store can be seen in this chart:

You can find more information about Vuex at https://vuex.vuejs.org/.

Creating and understanding the
Vuex state


The Vuex state can seem straightforward to understand. However, as the data
gets more in-depth and nested, its complexity and maintainability can get
more complicated.

In this recipe, we will learn how to create a Vuex state that can be used in the
scenarios of both a Progressive Web Application (PWA)/ Single Page
Application (SPA) and a Server Side Rendering (SSR), without any
problems.

Getting ready

The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we
used in the 'Lazy Loading your pages asynchronously' recipe in Chapter 6,
Managing Routes with vue-router, or we can start a new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create vuex-store

Choose the manual features, add Router and Vuex as required features, as
indicated in the 'How to do it...' section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex
store' recipe.

Our recipe will be divided into two parts:


Adding Vuex via the vue ui
Creating the Vuex state

Let's get started.

Adding Vuex via the vue ui

When importing an old project that was created via the Vue-CLI, it is
possible to automatically add Vuex through the vue ui interface without any
effort at all. We will learn how to add the Vuex library to the old project, so
we can continue developing the recipe.

In the following steps, we will add the Vuex with the vue ui interface:

1. In the project folder, open the vue ui by executing the following

command on Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows):

> vue ui

2. Select the correct project that you are working on. In the right sidebar,

click on the Plugins menu icon:


3. On the plugins page, on the top bar, click on the Add vuex button. This
will trigger a pop-up modal, then click on the Continue button to finish
the installation of Vuex on the application:


4. Adding the Vuex to our application will change the structure of the

application. First, we will notice that there is a new folder called store in
the src folder, and in the main.js file, it was added to the imports and the
injection of the store in the Vue application:

import './server/server';
import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import Vuesax from 'vuesax';
import './style.css';
import router from './router'
import store from './store'

Vue.use(Vuesax);

Vue.config.productionTip = false;

new Vue({
router,
store,
render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app');

Creating the Vuex state

In order to save the data inside of Vuex, you need to have an initial state that
is loaded with the application and defined as the default one when the user





enters your application. Here, we are going to learn how to create the Vuex
state and use it as a singleton, so that Vuex can be used in an SPA and an
SSR page:

Now we will create a Vuex store that can be used in an SSR and an SPA:

1. In the src/store folder, create a new folder called user, and inside this

folder create a new file named state.js.

2. Create a new generateState function. This function will return a

JavaScript object, with three main properties, data, loading, and error.
The data property will be a JavaScript object, with a property called
usersList defined as an empty array as default, and a property called
userData with the default object of a user. The loading property will be a
boolean, set to false by default, and error will have a default value
initializing to null:

const generateState = () => ({
data: {
usersList: [],
userData: {
name: '',
email: '',
birthday: '',
country: '',
phone: '',
},
},
loading: false,
error: null,
});

3. After creating the function, we will create an export default object at the
end of the file, which will be a JavaScript object, and we will destruct
the return of the generateState function:

export default { ...generateState() };

4. Create a new file named index.js in the user folder and open it.
5. Import the newly created state:

import state from './state';

6. At the end of the file, create an export default file as a JavaScript object.

In this object, we will add the imported state:


export default {
state,
};

7. Open the index.js file from the src/store folder.
8. Import the index.js file from the user folder:

import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';
import UserStore from './user';

9. In the export default function, which creates a new Vuex store, we will

remove all the properties inside of it,  and put the imported
UserStore deconstructed object inside the Vuex.Store parameter:

export default new Vuex.Store({
...UserStore,
})

How it works...

When using the vue ui to add Vuex as a plugin, the vue ui will automatically
add the required files, and import everything that is needed. This is the initial
phase of the creation of a Vuex store.

First is the creation of an exclusive file for managing the state that we can
use to separate, from the store, the process of how the state begins and how it
can be initialized.

In this case of this state, we used a function to generate a completely new
state every time it's called. This is a good practice, because in an SSR
environment, the state of the server will always be the same, and we need to
create a new state for each new connection.

After the creation of the state, we needed to create the default file for
exporting the Vuex files that will be created in the user folder. This file is a
simple import of all the files that will be created in the folder, state, actions,
mutation, and getters. After the import, we export an object with the name of
the required Vuex properties, state, actions, mutations, and getters.


Finally, in the Vuex store, we import the file that aggregates everything and
deconstructs it into our store to initialize it.

There's more...

The Vuex state is a single source of truth in your application, it works like a
global data manager, and it should not be changed directly. This is because
we need to prevent the mutation of data with a concurrent mutation of the
same data. To avoid that, we always need to change our state through the
mutations, because the functions are synchronous and controlled by Vuex.

See also

Find more information about the Vuex state at https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/stat
e.html.

Creating and understanding the
Vuex mutations

When there is a change in Vuex, we need a way to execute this change in
asynchronous form and keep track of it so it won't execute over another
change before the first change finishes.

For this case, we need the mutations, which are functions that are only
responsible for changing the state of your application.

In this recipe, we will learn how to create Vuex mutations and the best
practices by which to do it.

Getting ready

The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:


Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we
used in the 'Creating and understanding the Vuex state' recipe, or we can
start a new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> vue create vuex-store

Choose the manual features, add Router and Vuex as required features, as
indicated in the 'How to do it...' section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex
store' recipe.

Now we create a Vuex mutation and base type for the mutations:

1. Create a new file called types.js in the user folder inside the src/store

folder, and open it.

2. In this file, we will create an export default JavaScript object, with a

group of keys that will be the names of our mutations. Those keys will
be LOADING, ERROR, SET_USER_LIST, SET_USER_DATA, UPDATE_USER, and REMOVE_USER:

export default {
LOADING: 'LOADING',
ERROR: 'ERROR',
SET_USER_LIST: 'SET_USER_LIST',
SET_USER_DATA: 'SET_USER_DATA',
UPDATE_USER: 'UPDATE_USER',
REMOVE_USER: 'REMOVE_USER',
}

3. Create a new file called mutations.js in the user folder, and open it.


4. Import the newly created types.js file:

import MT from './types';

5. Create a new function called setLoading, which will receive the Vuex

state as an argument and will define the loading property of the state to
true when executed:

const setLoading = state => {
state.loading = true;
};

6. Create a new function called setError, which will receive the Vuex
state as an argument and payload. This function will set the loading
property of the state to false, and the error property to the received
payload argument:

const setError = (state, payload) => {
state.loading = false;
state.error = payload;
};

7. Create a new function called setUserList, which will receive the
Vuex state and payload as an argument. This function will define
the usersList property of the state.data to the received payload argument,
set the loading property of the state to false, and the error property to null:

const setUserList = (state, payload) => {
state.data.usersList = payload;
state.loading = false;
state.error = null;
};

8. Create a new function called setUserData, which will receive the
Vuex state and payload as arguments. This function will define
the userData property of the state.data to the received payload argument,
set the loading property of the state to false, and the error property to null:

const setUserData = (state, payload) => {
state.data.userData = payload;
state.loading = false;
state.error = null;
};

9. Create a new function called updateUser, which will receive the

Vuex state and payload as an argument. This function will update the user


data in the usersList property of the state.data, define the loading property
of the state to false, and the error property to null:

const updateUser = (state, payload) => {
const userIndex = state.data.usersList.findIndex(u => u.id ===
payload.id);
if (userIndex > -1) {
state.data.usersList[userIndex] = payload;
}
state.loading = false;
state.error = null;
};

10. Create a new function called removeUser, which will receive the

Vuex state and payload as an argument. This function will remove the
user data from the usersList property of the state.data, define
the loading property of the state to false, and the error property to null:

const removeUser = (state, payload) => {
const userIndex = state.data.usersList.findIndex(u => u.id ===
payload);
if (userIndex > -1) {
state.data.usersList.splice(userIndex, 1);
}
state.loading = false;
state.error = null;
};

11. Finally, create an export default object, with the keys being the types we
created in the types.js file, and define each of the keys to the functions
we created:

export default {
[MT.LOADING]: setLoading,
[MT.ERROR]: setError,
[MT.SET_USER_LIST]: setUserList,
[MT.SET_USER_DATA]: setUserData,
[MT.UPDATE_USER]: updateUser,
[MT.REMOVE_USER]: removeUser,
}

12. Open the index.js file in the user folder.
13. Import the newly created mutations.js file, and add it to the export default

JavaScript object:

import state from './state';
import mutations from './mutations';

export default {
state,



mutations,
};

How it works...

Each mutation is a function that will be called as a commit, and will have an
identifier in the Vuex store. This identifier is the mutation key in the exported
JavaScript object. In this recipe, we created a file that holds all the identifiers
as an object value so that it can be used as a constant inside our code.

This pattern helps us in the development of Vuex actions, which need to
know each mutation name.

When exporting the mutation JavaScript object, we use the constant as the key
and the corresponding function as its value, so the Vuex store can execute
the correct function when called.

Creating and understanding the
Vuex getters

Accessing data from Vuex can be done through the state itself, which can be
very dangerous, or via the getters. The getters are like data that can be
preprocessed and delivered without touching or messing with the Vuex store
state.

The whole idea behind getters is the possibility to write custom functions
that can extract data from your state in a single place when you need it, so
that you get just the data you need.


In this recipe, we will learn how to create a Vuex getter and a dynamic getter
that can be used as a high-order function.

Getting ready

The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we
used in the 'Creating and understanding the Vuex mutations' recipe, or we
can start a new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> vue create vuex-store

Choose the manual features, and add Router and Vuex as needed features, as
indicated in the 'How to do it...' section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex
store' recipe.

In the following steps, we will create the Vuex getters:

1. Create a new file called getters.js in the src/store/user folder.
2. Create a new function called getUsersList, and return the

state.data.usersList property:

function getUsersList(state) {
return state.data.usersList;
}


In a getter function, the first argument that the function will receive will be always the
current state of the Vuex store.

3. Create a new function called getUserData, and return

the state.data.userData property:

function getUserData(state) {
return state.data.userData;
}

4. Create a new function called getUserById, and return another function that
receives userId as an argument. This returning function will return the
result of a search of state.data.usersList that matches the same id as the
userId received:

function getUserById(state) {
return (userId) => {
return state.data.usersList.find(u => u.id === userId);
}
}

5. Create a new function called isLoading,  and return

the state.loading property:

function isLoading(state) {
return state.loading;
}

6. Create a new function called hasError, and return the state.error property:

function hasError(state) {
return state.error;
}

7. Finally, create an export default JavaScript object, with all the created

functions as properties:

export default {
getUsersList,
getUserData,
getUserById,
isLoading,
hasError,
};

8. Open the index.js file in the src/store/user folder.


9. Import the newly created getters.js file, and add it to the export default

JavaScript object:

import state from './state';
import mutations from './mutations';
import getters from './getters';

export default {
state,
mutations,
getters,
};

How it works...

Getters are like a GET function from an object and are static cached
functions – they only change the returned value when the state has changed.
But if you add the return as a high-order function, you can give it more
power to use a more sophisticated algorithm and provide specific data.

In this recipe, we created two types of getters: the most basic, with simple
data return, and the high-order function, which needs to be called as a
function to retrieve the value you want.

There's more...

Using getters with business logic is a good way to gather more data on the
state. This is a good pattern because, on larger projects, it helps other
developers to understand more what is going on in each of the GET
functions and how it works behind the curtain.

You always need to remember that getters are synchronous functions and
reactive to the state change, so the data on the getters is memoized and
cached until the single source of truth receives a commit and changes it.

de/getters.html.



Creating and understanding the
Vuex actions

You have all your state ready, your dataset, and now you need to fetch new
data from an outside source or change this data inside your application. Here
comes the part where actions do their job.

Actions are responsible for orchestrating the process in this communication
between the application and the outside world. Controlling when the data
need to be mutated on the state and returned to the caller of the action.

Usually, the action is a dispatch through a component or a view, but there are
some occasions where actions can dispatch another action to create a chain
of actions in your application.

In this recipe, we will learn how to create the actions needed in our
application to define a user's list, update a user, and remove a user.

Getting ready

The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we
used in the 'Creating and understanding the Vuex getters' recipe, or we can
start a new one.


To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> vue create vuex-store

Choose the manual features, and add Router and Vuex as required features, as
indicated in the 'How to do it... section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex
store' recipe.

Now follow these steps to create the Vuex actions:

1. Create a new file called actions.js in the src/store/user folder.
2. Import the mutation types files (types.js), and the getHttp, patchHttp,

postHttp, and deleteHttp functions from the fetchApi wrapper:

import {
getHttp,
patchHttp,
deleteHttp,
postHttp,
} from '@/http/fetchApi';
import MT from './types';

3. Create a new asynchronous function called createUser, which receives as the

first argument a deconstructed JavaScript object, with the
commit property, and userData as the second argument, which will be used
to create the user. Add a try/catch statement, in the try context. First, we
execute commit(MT.LOADING), then we fetch the users lists from the API, and
finally, commit(MT.SET_USER_DATA, data), passing the users lists to be
mutated. If we receive an exception and get into the Catch statement, we
will execute commit(MT.ERROR, error), passing the error that we receive to
the state:

async function createUser({ commit }, userData) {
try {
commit(MT.LOADING);
await postHttp(`/api/users`, {
data: {
...userData,
}
});
commit(MT.SET_USER_DATA, userData);
} catch (error) {
commit(MT.ERROR, error);


}
}

4. Create a new asynchronous function called fetchUsersList, which receives as

the first argument a deconstructed JavaScript object, with the
commit property. Add a try/catch statement in the try context. We
execute commit(MT.LOADING), then we fetch the users lists from the API, and
finally, commit(MT.SET_USER_LIST, data), passing the users lists to be
mutated. If we receive an exception and get into the catch statement, we
will execute a mutation of commit(MT.ERROR, error), passing the error that
we receive to the state:

async function fetchUsersList({ commit }) {
try {
commit(MT.LOADING);
const { data } = await getHttp(`api/users`);
commit(MT.SET_USER_LIST, data);
} catch (error) {
commit(MT.ERROR, error);
}
}

5. Create a new asynchronous function called fetchUsersData, which receives as

the first argument a deconstructed JavaScript object, with the
commit property, and the second argument the userId that will be fetched.
Add a try/catch statement, in the try context. We
execute commit(MT.LOADING), then we fetch the users lists from the API, and
finally, commit(MT.SET_USER_DATA, data), passing the users lists to be
mutated. If we receive an exception and get into the catch statement, we
will execute a mutation of commit(MT.ERROR, error), passing the error that
we receive to the state:

async function fetchUserData({ commit }, userId) {
try {
commit(MT.LOADING);
const { data } = await getHttp(`api/users/${userId}`);
commit(MT.SET_USER_DATA, data);
} catch (error) {
commit(MT.ERROR, error);
}
}

6. Create a new asynchronous function called updateUser, which receives as the

first argument a deconstructed JavaScript object, with the
commit property, and payload as the second argument. Add
a try/catch statement, in the try context. We execute commit(MT.LOADING),


then we patch the user data to the API and finally commit(MT.UPDATE_USER,
payload), passing the user new data to be mutated. If we receive an
exception and get into the catch statement, we will execute a
mutation of commit(MT.ERROR, error), passing the error that we received to
the state:

async function updateUser({ commit }, payload) {
try {
commit(MT.LOADING);
await patchHttp(`api/users/${payload.id}`, {
data: {
...payload,
}
});
commit(MT.UPDATE_USER, payload);
} catch (error) {
commit(MT.ERROR, error);
}
}

7. Create a new asynchronous function called removeUser, which receives as the

first argument a deconstructed JavaScript object, with the
commit property, and userId as the second argument. Add
a try/catch statement, in the try context. We execute commit(MT.LOADING),
then we delete the user data from the API and
finally, commit(MT.REMOVE_USER, userId), passing the userId to be used in the
mutation. If we receive an exception and get into the Catch statement, we
will execute a mutation of commit(MT.ERROR, error), passing the error that
we receive to the state:

async function removeUser({ commit }, userId) {
try {
commit(MT.LOADING);
await deleteHttp(`api/users/${userId}`);
commit(MT.REMOVE_USER, userId);
} catch (error) {
commit(MT.ERROR, error);
}
}

8. Finally, we will create an export default JavaScript object, with all the

created functions as properties:

export default {
createUser,
fetchUsersList,
fetchUserData,
updateUser,


removeUser,
}

9. Import the newly created actions.js file in the index.js in the src/store/user

folder, and add it to the export default JavaScript object:

import state from './state';
import mutations from './mutations';
import getters from './getters';
import actions from './actions';

export default {
state,
mutations,
getters,
actions,
};

How it works...

Actions are the initializers of all the Vuex life cycle changes. When
dispatched, the action can execute a mutation commit, or another action
dispatch, or even an API call to the server.

In our case, we took our API calls and put it inside the actions, so when the
asynchronous function returns, we can execute the commit and set the state
to the result of the function.

Creating a dynamic component
with Vuex

Combining Vuex with Vue components, it's possible to employ the reactivity
between multiple components without the need for direct parent-child
communication, and split the responsibilities of the components.



Using this method allows the developer to enhance the scale of the
application, where there is no need to store the state of the data inside the
components itself, but using a single source of truth as a store for the whole
application.

In this recipe, we will use the last recipes to improve an application, where it
was using parent-child communication and making it as a single source of
truth available in the whole application.

Getting ready

The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To create our dynamic component, we will transform the components from
stateful to stateless, and will extract some parts that can be made into new
components as well.

We will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we used in the 'Creating and
understanding the Vuex actions' recipe, or we can start a new one.

To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> vue create vuex-store

Choose the manual features, and add Router and Vuex as required features, as
indicated in the 'How to do it...' section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex


store' recipe.

Our recipe will be divided into five parts:

Creating the user list component
Editing the user list page
Editing the user view page
Editing the user view page
Editing the user create page

Let's get started.

Creating the user list component

Because Vuex gives us the ability to have a single source of truth on our
application, we can create a new component for our application that will
handle the user listing and triggers the Vuex action that fetches the users list
from the server. This component can be stateless and execute the Vuex actions
by itself.

Single file component <script> section

Let's code the <script> section of the single file component:

1. Create a new file called userList.vue in the src/components folder.
2. Import the changeRouterMixin from the src/mixin folder:

import changeRouteMixin from '@/mixin/changeRoute';

3. Create an export default JavaScript object, and add a new Vue property
called mixin, with a default value of an array. To this array, add the
imported changeRouteMixin:

mixins: [changeRouteMixin],

4. Create a new Vue property called computed. In this property, create a new
value called userList. This property will be a function returning the Vuex
store getter getUsersList:


computed: {
userList() {
return this.$store.getters.getUsersList;
},
},

Single file component <template> section

Here, we are going to code the <template> section of the single file
component:

1. Open the List.vue file from the users folder inside the views folder and

copy the content and component from the VsTable component.

2. Open the userList.vue file from the src/components folder.
3. Paste the content you'd copied from the List.vue file inside the <template>

section:

<template>
<vs-table
:data="userList"
search
stripe
pagination
max-items="10"
style="width: 100%; padding: 20px;"
>
<template slot="thead">
<vs-th sort-key="name">
#
</vs-th>
<vs-th sort-key="name">
Name
</vs-th>
<vs-th sort-key="email">
Email
</vs-th>
<vs-th sort-key="country">
Country
</vs-th>
<vs-th sort-key="phone">
Phone
</vs-th>
<vs-th sort-key="Birthday">
Birthday
</vs-th>
<vs-th>
Actions
</vs-th>
</template>
<template slot-scope="{data}">
<vs-tr :key="index" v-for="(tr, index) in data">
<vs-td :data="data[index].id">
{{data[index].id}}
</vs-td>


<vs-td :data="data[index].name">
{{data[index].name}}
</vs-td>
<vs-td :data="data[index].email">
<a :href="`mailto:${data[index].email}`">
{{data[index].email}}
</a>
</vs-td>
<vs-td :data="data[index].country">
{{data[index].country}}
</vs-td>
<vs-td :data="data[index].phone">
{{data[index].phone}}
</vs-td>
<vs-td :data="data[index].birthday">
{{data[index].birthday}}
</vs-td>
<vs-td :data="data[index].id">
<vs-button
color="primary"
type="filled"
icon="remove_red_eye"
size="small"
@click="changeRoute('view', data[index].id)"
/>
<vs-button
color="success"
type="filled"
icon="edit"
size="small"
@click="changeRoute('edit', data[index].id)"
/>
<vs-button
color="danger"
type="filled"
icon="delete"
size="small"
@click="deleteUser(data[index].id)"
/>
</vs-td>
</vs-tr>
</template>
</vs-table>
</template>

Editing the user list page

Now that we have extracted the user list into a new component, we need to
import this component and remove the old VsTable that was cluttering our
view.

Single file component <script> section


In this step, we are going to write the <script> section of the single file
component:

1. Open the List.vue file in the users folder inside the views folder.
2. Import the newly created Users List component, from the components

folder:

import changeRouteMixin from '@/mixin/changeRoute';
import UserTableList from '@/components/userList';

3. In the export default JavaScript object, add a new property called

components. Declare the property as a JavaScript object, and add the
imported UserTableList component to the object:

components: { UserTableList },

4. In the methods property, at the getAllUsers function, we need to change the

content to execute a Vuex dispatch when called. This method will
perform the fetchUsersList Vuex action:

async getAllUsers() {
this.$store.dispatch('fetchUsersList');
},

5. Finally, in the deleteUser function, we need to change the content to
execute a Vuex dispatch when called. This method will perform
the removeUser Vuex action, passing the userId as the argument:

async deleteUser(id) {
this.$store.dispatch('removeUser', id);
await this.getAllUsers();
},

Single file component <template> section

Let's code the <template> section of the single file component:

1. Open the List.vue file in the users folder inside the view folder.
2. Replace the VsTable component and its contents with the newly imported

UserTableList:

<vs-col
vs-type="flex"


vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="12">
<user-table-list />
</vs-col>

Editing the user view page

Now we can add the Vuex to the user view page. We will add the Vuex
actions and getters to manipulate the data, and extract from the page the
responsibility of managing it.

Single file component <script> section

Now you are going to create the <script> section of the single file component:

1. Open the View.vue file from the users folder inside the view folder.
2. Remove the Vue data property.
3. Inside the Vue computed property, add the userData, returning a Vuex

getter, getUserData:

userData() {
return this.$store.getters.getUserData;
},

4. Finally, in the getUserById method, change the content to dispatch a Vuex

action, fetchUserData, passing the computed userId property as a
parameter:

async getUserById() {
await this.$store.dispatch('fetchUserData', this.userId);
},

Single file component <template> section

It's time to write the <template> section of the single file component:

1. Open the View.vue file in the users folder inside the view folder.
2. In the UserForm component, change the v-model directive to a :value

directive:


<user-form
:value="userData"
disabled
/>

When using a read-only value, or you need to remove the syntactic sugar of the v-model
directive, you can declare the input value as a :value directive and the value change
event to an @input event listener.

Editing the user edit page

We need to edit our user. In the last recipe, we used a stateful page and
executed everything within the page. We will transform the state into a
temporary state, and execute the API calls on the Vuex actions.

Single file component <script> section

Here, we are going to create the <script> section of the single file component:

1. Open the Edit.vue file in the users folder inside the view folder.
2. In the Vue data property, change the name of the data from userData to

tmpUserData:

data: () => ({
tmpUserData: {
name: '',
email: '',
birthday: '',
country: '',
phone: '',
},
}),

3. In the Vue computed property, add a new property called userData, which

will return the Vuex getter getUserData:

userData() {
return this.$store.getters.getUserData;
}

4. Add a new Vue property named watch, and add a new property, userData,
which will be a JavaScript object. In this object, add three properties,
handler, immediate, and deep. The handler property will be a function that
receives an argument called newData, which will set tmpUserData to this
argument. The immediate and deep properties are both boolean properties
set to true:


watch: {
userData: {
handler(newData) {
this.tmpUserData = newData;
},
immediate: true,
deep: true,
}
},

5. In the Vue methods property, we need to change the contents of

getUserById to dispatch a Vuex action named fetchUserData, passing the
computed property userId as a parameter:

async getUserById() {
await this.$store.dispatch('fetchUserData', this.userId);
},

6. In the updateUser method, change the content to dispatch a Vuex action

named updateUser, passing tmpUserData as a parameter:

async updateUser() {
await this.$store.dispatch('updateUser', this.tmpUserData);
this.changeRoute('list');
},

Single file component <template> section

In this part, we are going to write the <template> section of the single file
component:

1. Open the Edit.vue in the users folder inside the view folder.
2. Change the target of the v-model directive of the UserForm component to

tmpUserData:

<vs-col
vs-type="flex"
vs-justify="left"
vs-align="left"
vs-w="12"
style="margin: 20px"
>
<user-form
v-model="tmpUserData"
/>
</vs-col>

Editing the user create page


For the user create page, the changes will be minimal, as it only executes an
API call. We need to add the Vuex action dispatch.

Single file component <script> section

Here, we are going to create the <script> section of the single file component:

1. Open the Create.vue file in the users folder inside the view folder.
2. Change the content of the createUser method to dispatch a Vuex action

named createUser, passing userData as the parameter:

async createUser() {
await this.$store.dispatch('createUser', this.userData);
this.changeRoute('list');
},

How it works...

In all four pages, we made changes that removed the business logic or API
calls from the page to the Vuex store and tried making it less responsible for
maintaining the data.

Because of that, we could place a piece of code into a new component that
can be placed anywhere in our application, and will show the current users
lists without any limitations from the container that is instantiating it.

This pattern helps us in the development of more prominent applications,
where there is a need for components that are less business-oriented and
more focused on their tasks.

Adding hot-module-reload for
development

The hot-module-reload (HMR) is a technique used for the faster
development of the application, where you don't need to refresh the whole
page to get the new code you have just changed on the editor. The HMR will
change and refresh only the part that were updated by you on the editor.

In all the Vue-CLI projects or Vue-based frameworks, such as Quasar
Framework, the HMR is present in the presentation of the application. So
each time you change any file that is a Vue component and it's rendered, the
application will replace the old code for the new one on the fly.

In this recipe, we will learn how to add HMR to a Vuex store and be able to
change the Vuex store without the need to refresh our entire application.

Getting ready

The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To start our component, we will use the Vue project with Vue-CLI that we
used in the 'Creating a dynamic component with Vuex' recipe, or we can start
a new one.


To start a new one, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> vue create vuex-store

Choose the manual features, add Router and Vuex as required features, as
indicated in the 'How to do it...' section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex
store' recipe.

In the following steps, we will add HMR to Vuex:

1. Open the index.js file in the src/store folder.
2. Transform the export default into a constant called store, and make it

exportable:

export const store = new Vuex.Store({
...UserStore,
});

3. Check if the webpack hot-module-reload plugin is active:

if (module.hot) {}

4. Create a new constant called hmr, which is an array containing the

direction to the index.js, getters.js, actions.js, and mutations.js files of the
user folder:

const hmr = [
'./user',
'./user/getters',
'./user/actions',
'./user/mutations',
];

5. Create a new function called reloadCallback. In this function, create three
constants, getters, actions, and mutations. Each constant will point to the
equivalent file inside the user folder, and call the store.hotUpdate function,
passing an object as an argument with the values for the constants you
created:

const reloadCallback = () => {
const getters = require('./user/getters').default;
const actions = require('./user/actions').default;


const mutations =  require('./user/mutations').default;

store.hotUpdate({
getters,
actions,
mutations,
})
};

Because of the Babel output of the files, you need to add the .default in the end of the
files that you are dynamically importing with the webpack require function.

6. Execute the webpack HMR accept function, passing as the first

argument the hmr constant and reloadCallback as the second argument:

module.hot.accept(hmr, reloadCallback);

7. Finally, default export the created store:

export default store;

How it works...

The Vuex store supports HMR with the API of the webpack HMR plugin.

When it's available, we create a list of possible files that can be updated, so
that webpack can be aware of any updates to those files. When any of those
files are updated, a special callback that you created is executed. This
callback is the one that enables Vuex to update or change the behavior of the
updated file entirely.

Creating a Vuex module



As our application grows, working in a single object can be very risky. The
maintainability of the project and the risks that it can generate on every
change get worse each time.

Vuex has an approach called modules that helps us to separate our store into
different branches of stores. These branches, or modules, have on each one
of them a different set of state, mutation, getter, and action. This pattern
helps with development and cuts the risk of adding new features to the
application.

In this recipe, we will learn how to create a module and how to work with it,
separating it into dedicated branches.

Getting ready

The prerequisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

Choose the manual features and add Router and Vuex as required features, as
indicated in the 'How to do it...' section of the 'Creating a simple Vuex
store' recipe.

Our recipe will be divided into two parts:

Creating the new authentication module
Adding modules to Vuex

Let's get started.

Creating the new authentication module

To start, we need to create a new Vuex module. This example module will be
called authentication, and will store the credentials data for the user.

In these steps, we will create the authentication module for Vuex:

1. Create a new folder called authentication in the src/store folder.
2. In this newly created folder, create a new file called state.js, and open

it.

3. Create a function called generateState that will return a JavaScript object
with the properties of data.username, data.token, data.expiresAt, loading, and
error:

const generateState = () => ({
data: {
username: '',
token: '',
expiresAt: null,
},
loading: false,
error: null,
});

4. Create an export default object at the end of the file. This object will be a

JavaScript object. We will destruct the return of
the generateState function:

export default { ...generateState() };


5. Create a new file called index.js in the authentication folder inside the

src/store folder, and open it.

6. Import the newly created state.js file:

import state from './state';

7. Create an export default object at the end of the file. This object will be a
JavaScript object. Add a new property called namespaced with the value
set to true, and add the imported state:

export default {
namespaced: true,
state,
};

Adding the modules to Vuex

Now that we've created our modules, we will add them to the Vuex store. We
can integrate the new modules with our old code. This is not a problem
because Vuex will handle the new module as a namespaced object, with a
completely separate Vuex store.

Now in these steps, we will add the created modules to the Vuex:

1. Open the index.js file in the src/store folder.
2. Import the index.js file from the authentication folder:

import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';
import UserStore from './user';
import Authentication from './authentication';

3. In the Vuex.Store function, add a new property called modules, which is a

JavaScript object. Then add the imported User and
Authentication modules:

export default new Vuex.Store({
...UserStore,
modules: {
Authentication,
}
})


How it works...

Modules work like separate Vuex stores but in the same Vuex single source
of truth. This helps in the development of larger-scale applications because
you can maintain and work with a more complex structure without the need
to check for problems in the same file.

In the meantime, it's possible to work with modules and the plain Vuex store,
migrating from legacy applications so you don't have to re-write everything
from the ground up to be able to use the module structure.

In our case, we added a new module named authentication with just a state
present in the store, and continued with the old user Vuex store, so that in the
future we can refactor the user store into a new module and separate it off
into a more specific, domain-driven architecture.

Animating Your Application with
Transitions and CSS

To have a more dynamic application and have the full attention of the user,
using animation is crucial. Today, CSS animations are present in toasts,
banners, notifications, and even input fields.

There are some cases where you need to create special animations, known as
transitions, and have full control of what is happening on your page. To do
this, you must use custom components and have the framework to help you
with rendering your application.

With Vue, we can use two custom components that can help us create
animations and transitions in our application with the help of CSS classes.
Those components are Transition and TransitionGroup.

In this chapter, we will learn how to create a CSS animation, use the
Animate.css framework to create a custom transition, use the Transition
component hook to execute custom functions, create animations that execute
on the render of the component, create animations and transitions for groups
and lists, create reusable custom transition components, and create seamless
transitions between components.

In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:

Creating your first CSS animation
Creating a custom transition class with Animate.css
Creating transactions with custom hooks
Creating animations on page render
Creating animations for lists and groups
Creating a custom transition component
Creating a seamless transition between elements

Technical requirements


In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue-CLI.

Attention Windows users! You need to install an NPM package called windows-build-
tools to be able to install the following required packages. To do so, open PowerShell as
an Administrator and execute the
> npm install -g windows-build-tools command.

To install Vue-CLI, you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
a Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global

Creating the base project

In this chapter, we will use this project as the base for each recipe. Here, I
will guide you through how to create the base project:

1. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or a Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create {replace-with-recipe-name}

2. Vue-CLI will ask for you to choose a preset; select Manually select

features using the spacebar:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
default (babel, eslint)
❯ Manually select features

3. Now, Vue-CLI will ask for what features you wish to install. You will
need to select CSS Pre-processors as an additional feature on top of the
default ones:

? Check the features needed for your project: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Babel
TypeScript
Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
Router
Vuex
❯ CSS Pre-processors
❯ Linter / Formatter
Unit Testing
E2E Testing


4. Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatter. In our case, we

will select ESLint + Airbnb config:

? Pick a linter / formatter config: (Use arrow keys)
ESLint with error prevention only
❯ ESLint + Airbnb config
ESLint + Standard config
ESLint + Prettier

5. Choose the additional features of the linter. In our case, select the Lint

on save and Lint and fix on commit:

? Pick additional lint features: (Use arrow keys)
Lint on save
❯ Lint and fix on commit

6. Select where you want to place the linter and formatter configuration

files. In our case, we will select In dedicated config files:

? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? (Use arrow
keys)
❯ In dedicated config files
In package.json

7. Finally, the CLI will ask you whether you want to save the settings for
future projects; select N. After that, Vue-CLI will create the folder and
install the dependencies for you:

? Save this as a preset for future projects? (y/N) n

8. From the created project, open the App.vue file, which is located in the
src folder. In the <script> section of the single file component, remove
the HelloWorld component. Add a data property and define it as a
singleton function that's returning a JavaScript object with a property
named display, and with a default value of true:

<script>
export default {
name: 'App',
data: () => ({
display: true,
}),
};
</script>

9. In the <template> section of the single file component, remove the

HelloWorld component and add a button HTML element with the text


Toggle. In the img HTML element, add a v-if directive bounded to the
display variable. Finally, in the button HTML element, add a click event.
In the event listener, define the value as an anonymous function that
sets the display variable as the negation of the display variable:

<template>
<div id="app">
<button @click="display = !display">
Toggle
</button>
<img
v-if="display"
alt="Vue logo" src="./assets/logo.png">
</div>
</template>

With these instructions, we can create a base project for each recipe in this
chapter.

Creating your first CSS animation

With the help of CSS, we can animate our application without the need to
manually program the changes of DOM elements through JavaScript. Using
special CSS properties dedicated exclusively to controlling animations, we
can achieve beautiful animations and transitions.

To use the animations that are available in Vue, we need to use a component
called Transition when an animation is being applied to a single element or a
component called TransitionGroup when dealing with a list of components.

In this recipe, we will learn how to create a CSS animation and apply this
animation to a single element on the Vue application.

Getting ready

The following are the prerequisites for this recipe:

Node.js 12+
A Vue-CLI base project called cssanimation


The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe called
cssanimation and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:

1. Open the App.vue file. In the <template> section of the single file

component, wrap the img HTML element with a Transaction component.
In the Transaction component, add a name attribute with a value of "image":

<transition name="image">
<img
v-if="display"
alt="Vue logo" src="./assets/logo.png">
</transition>

2. In the <style> section of the single file component, create an .image-enter-
active class with an animation property that has a value of bounce-in .5s.
Then, create an .image-leave-active class with an animation property that
has a value of bounce-in .5s reverse:

.image-enter-active {
animation: bounce-in .5s;
}
.image-leave-active {
animation: bounce-in .5s reverse;
}

3. Finally, create a @keyframes bounce-in CSS rule. Inside it, do the following:

Create a 0% rule with a property transform and a value of scale(0).
Create a 50% rule with a property transform and a value
of scale(1.5).
Create a 100% rule with a property transform and a value of scale(1):

@keyframes bounce-in {
0% {
transform: scale(0);
}
50% {
transform: scale(1.5);
}


100% {
transform: scale(1);
}
}

After doing this, your image will scale up and disappear when the toggle
button is pressed for the first time. When pressed again, it will scale up and
stay in the correct scale after the animation has finished:

How it works...

First, we added the Vue animation wrapper to the element we wanted to add
the transition to, and then added the name of the CSS class that will be used
on the transition.


The Transition component uses pre-made namespaces for the CSS class that are required
to be present. These are -enter-active, for when the component enters the screen, and -
leave-active, for when the component leaves the screen.

Then, we create the CSS classes in <style> for the transition of the element to
leave and enter the screen, and the keyframe ruleset for the bounce-in animation
in order to define how it will behave.

la.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes.

Creating a custom transition class
with Animate.css

In the Transition component, it is possible to define the CSS classes that will
be used in each transition step. By using this property, we can make the
Transition component use Animate.css in the transition animations.

In this recipe, we will learn how to use the Animate.css classes with the
Transition component in order to create custom transitions in our components.

Getting ready

The following are the prerequisites for this recipe:

Node.js 12+
A Vue-CLI base project called animatecss

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:


@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe
called animatecss and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:

1. Inside the project folder, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or

a Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command to install the Animate.css framework:

> npm install animate.css@3.7.2

2. Open the main.js file in the src folder and import the Animate.css

framework:

import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import 'animate.css';

3. Open the App.vue file in the src folder and add a Transition component as a
wrapper for the img HTML element. In the Transition component, add an
attribute called enter-active-class and define it as "animated bounceInLeft".
Then, add another attribute called leave-active-class and define it as
"animated bounceOutLeft":

<transition
enter-active-class="animated bounceInLeft"
leave-active-class="animated bounceOutLeft"
>
<img
v-if="display"
alt="Vue logo" src="./assets/logo.png">
</transition>

After doing this, your image will slide out to the left and disappear when the
toggle button is pressed for the first time. When pressed again, it will slide in
from the left:


How it works...

The Transition component can receive up to six props that can set up custom
classes for each step of the transaction. Those props are enter-class, enter-
active-class, enter-to-class, leave-class, leave-active-class, and leave-to-class. In
this recipe, we used enter-active-class and leave-active-class; these props
defined the custom classes for when the element is visible on the screen or
leaves the screen.


To use custom animations, we used the Animate.css framework, which
provides custom CSS animations that have been pre-made and ready for use.
We used bounceInLeft and bounceOutLeft in order to make the element slide in
and out from the screen.

There's more...

You can try to change the classes of the enter-active-class and leave-active-
class props for any of the props available on Animate.css and see how the
CSS animation behaves on the browser.

You can find the full list of available classes in the Animate.css
documentation at https://animate.style/.

Creating transactions with custom
hooks

The Transaction component has custom event emitters for each animation life
cycle. These can be used to attach custom functions and methods to be
executed when the animations cycle is completed.

We can use these methods to execute data fetches after the page transaction
completes or a button animation ends, thus chaining animations in a specific
order that need to be executed one after another based on dynamic data.


In this recipe, we will learn how to use the custom event emitters of the
Transaction component to execute custom methods.

Getting ready

The following are the prerequisites for this recipe:

Node.js 12+
A Vue-CLI base project called transactionhooks

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe
called transactionhooks and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:

1. Inside the project folder, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or

a Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command to install the Animate.css framework:

> npm install animate.css@3.7.2

2. Open the main.js file in the src folder and import

the Animate.css framework:

import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import 'animate.css';

3. Open the App.vue file in the src folder. In the <script> section of the single
file component, in the data property, in the singleton function, add a
new property called status with the value defined as "appeared":

data: () => ({
display: true,


status: 'appeared',
}),

4. Create a methods property and define it as a JavaScript object. Inside the

object, add two properties called onEnter and onLeave. In the onEnter
property, define it as a function, and inside of it, set the data status
variable to"appeared". In the onLeave property, define it as a function, and
inside of it set the data status variable to "disappeared":

methods: {
onEnter() {
this.status = 'appeared';
},
onLeave() {
this.status = 'disappeared';
},
},

5. In the <template> section of the single file component, add

a Transition component as a wrapper for the img HTML element. In
the Transition component, do the following:

Add an attribute called enter-active-class and define it as "animated
rotateIn".
Add another attribute called leave-active-class and define it
as "animated rotateOut".
Add an event listener after-enter bind and attach it to the onEnter
method.
Add an event listener after-leave bind and attach it to the onLeave
method:

<transition
enter-active-class="animated rotateIn"
leave-active-class="animated rotateOut"
@after-enter="onEnter"
@after-leave="onLeave"
>
<img
v-if="display"
alt="Vue logo" src="./assets/logo.png">
</transition>

6. Create an h1 HTML element as a sibling of the Transition component and

add the text The image {{ status }}:

<h1>The image {{ status }}</h1>


Now, when the button is clicked, the text will change when the animation
finishes. It will show The image appeared when the animation finishes
entering and The image disappeared when the animation has finished
leaving:

How it works...

The Transition component has eight custom hooks. These hooks are triggered
by the CSS animations and when they are triggered, they emit custom
events, which can be used by the parent component. These custom events


are before-enter, enter, after-enter, enter-cancelled, before-leave, leave, after-leave,
and leave-cancelled.

When using the after-enter and after-leave hooks, when the CSS animations
have finished, the text on the screen changes accordingly to the functions
that have been defined on the event listeners for each hook.

uide/transitions-enterleave.html#javascript-hooks.

Creating animations on page render

Using page transition animations or custom animations that are displayed on
the render of a page is common and sometimes needed to catch the attention
of the user of an application.

It's possible to create this effect in a Vue application without the need to
refresh the page or re-render all the elements on the screen. You can do this
using the Transition component or the TransitionGroup component.

In this recipe, we will learn how to use the Transition component so that the
animation is triggered when the page is being rendered.

Getting ready

The following are the prerequisites for this recipe:

Node.js 12+
A Vue-CLI base project called transactionappear

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:


@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe called
transactionappear and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:

1. Inside the project folder, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or

a Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command to install the Animate.css framework:

> npm install animate.css@3.7.2

2. Open the main.js file in the src folder and import

the Animate.css framework:

import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import 'animate.css';

3. Open the App.vue file in the src folder and add a Transition component as a
wrapper for the img HTML element. In the Transition component, do the
following:

Add an attribute called appear-active-class and define it as "animated
jackInTheBox".
Add an attribute called enter-active-class and define it as "animated
jackInTheBox".
Add another attribute called leave-active-class and define it
as "animated rollOut".
Add the appear attribute and define it as true:

<transition
appear
appear-active-class="animated jackInTheBox"
enter-active-class="animated jackInTheBox"
leave-active-class="animated rollOut"
>
<img
v-if="display"
alt="Vue logo" src="./assets/logo.png">
</transition>


When the page opens, the Vue logo will shake like a jack-in-the-box and will
be static after the animation has finished running:

How it works...

The Transition component has a special property called appear that, when
enabled, makes the element trigger an animation when it is rendered on the
screen. This property comes with three properties for controlling the
animation CSS classes, which are called appear-class, appear-to-class, and
appear-active-class.

There are four custom hooks that are executed with this property as well,
which are called before-appear, appear, after-appear, and appear-cancelled.

In our case, we made the component execute the jackInTheBox animation from
the Animate.css framework when the component gets rendered on-screen.

3.vuejs.org/guide/transitions-enterleave.html#transitions-on-initial-render.


You can find more information about Animate.css at https://animate.style/.

Creating animations for lists and
groups

There are some animations that need to be executed within a group of
elements or a list. These animations need to be wrapped in a TransitionGroup
element in order to work.

This component has some properties that are the same as the ones in
the Transition component, but to get it working, you have to define a set of
special instructions for the child elements and the components that are
specific to this component.

In this recipe, we will create a dynamic list of images that will be added
when the user clicks on the respective button. This will execute the
animation when the image appears on the screen.

Getting ready

The following are the prerequisites for this recipe:

Node.js 12+
A Vue-CLI base project called transactiongroup

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe
called transactiongroup and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:


1. Inside the project folder, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or

a Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command to install the Animate.css framework:

> npm install animate.css@3.7.2

2. Open the main.js file in the src folder and import

the Animate.css framework:

import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import 'animate.css';

3. Open the App.vue file in the src folder. In the <script> section of the single
file component, on the data singleton, return a property called count with
a value of 0:

data: () => ({
count: 0,
}),

4. In the <template> section of the single file component, remove everything
inside the div#app HTML element. Then, as a child of the div#app HTML
element, create a TransitionGroup component with an attribute called tag
defined as "ul" and an attribute called enter-active-class defined as
"animated zoomIn":

<div id="app">
<transition-group
tag="ul"
enter-active-class="animated zoomIn"
></transition-group>
</div>

5. As a child of the TransitionGroup component, create a li HTML element
with the v-for directive, iterating over the count variable as i in count.
Add a variable attribute called key defined as i and a style attribute
defined as "float: left". As a child of the li HTML component, create
an img HTML component with the src attribute defined as
"https://picsum.photos/100":

<li
v-for="i in count"
:key="i"
style="float: left"
>


<img src="https://picsum.photos/100"/>
</li>

6. Then, as a sibling element of the TransitionGroup component, create a hr

HTML element with the style attribute defined as "clear: both":

<hr style="clear: both"/>

7. Finally, as a sibling of the hr HTML element, create a button HTML

element with the click event, adding 1 to the current count variable and
setting the text to Increase:

<button
@click="count = count + 1"
>
Increase
</button>

Now, when the user clicks the respective button to increase the list, it will
add a new item to the list and the zooming in animation will trigger:

How it works...

The TransitionGroup element creates a wrapper element with the tag you
declared in the tag property. This will manage the custom elements that will
trigger the animation by checking the unique identity of the child elements
by their unique keys. Because of this, all the child elements inside the
TransitionGroup component need to have a key declared and have to be unique.


In our case, we created an HTML list using a combination of ul and li
HTML elements, where TransitionGroup was defined with the ul tag and the
child elements were defined with the li HTML elements. Then, we created a
virtual iteration over a number. This means there will be a list of items and
display images on-screen according to the number of items on that list.

To increase our list, we created a button HTML element that increased the
count of the count variable by one each time it was pressed.

Creating a custom transition
component

Using a framework to create an application is good because you can make
reusable components and shareable code. Using this pattern is great for
simplifying the development of the application.

Creating a reusable transition component is the same as creating a reusable
component and can have a simpler approach as it can be used with
functional rendering instead of the normal rendering method.

In this recipe, we will learn how to create a reusable functional component
that can be used in our application.

Getting ready

The following are the prerequisites for this chapter:


Node.js 12+
A Vue-CLI base project called customtransition

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe
called customtransition and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:

1. Inside the project folder, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or

a Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command to install the Animate.css framework:

> npm install animate.css@3.7.2

2. Open the main.js file in the src folder and import

the Animate.css framework:

import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import 'animate.css';

3. Create a new file named CustomTransition.vue in the src/components folder
and open it. In the <template> section of the single file component, add
the functional attribute to enable the functional rendering of the
component. Then, create a Transition component, with the appear variable
attribute defined as props.appear. Define the enter-active-class attribute
as "animated slideInLeft" and the leave-active-class attribute as "animated
slideOutRight". Finally, inside the Transition component, add a <slot>
placeholder:

<template functional>
<transition
:appear="props.appear"
enter-active-class="animated slideInLeft"
leave-active-class="animated slideOutRight"
>
<slot />


</transition>
</template>

4. Open the App.vue file in the src folder. In the <script> section of the single
file component, import the newly created CustomTransition component.
On the Vue object, add a new property called components, define it as a
JavaScript object, and add the imported CustomTransition component:

<script>
import CustomTransition from './components/CustomTransition.vue';

export default {
name: 'App',
components: {
CustomTransition,
},
data: () => ({
display: true,
}),
};
</script>

5. Finally, in the <template> section of the single file component, wrap the

img HTML element with the CustomTransition component:

<custom-transition>
<img
v-if="display"
alt="Vue logo" src="./assets/logo.png">
</custom-transition>

With this custom component, it's possible to reuse the transition without the
need to redeclare the Transition component and the transition CSS classes on
the component:



How it works...

First, we created a custom component using the functional component
method, where there is no need to declare the <script> section of the single
file component.

In this custom component, we used the Transaction component as the base
component. Then, we defined the appear attribute with the injected functional
context, prop.appear, and added the animations classes for the transition to
slide in from the left when the component is rendered and slide out from the
right when it's destroyed.

Then, in the main application, we used this custom component to wrap the
img HTML element and make it work as the Transition component.

Creating a seamless transition
between elements

When there are animations and transitions between two components, they
need to be seamless so that the user won't see the DOM shaking and
redrawing itself when the components are being placed on the screen. To
achieve this, we can use the Transition component and the transition mode
property to define how the transition will occur.

In this recipe, we will create a transition between images using the Transition
component and the transition mode attribute to create a seamless animation.

Node.js 12+
A Vue-CLI base project called seamlesstransition

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...


Using the base project, create a new project for this recipe called
seamlesstransition and open the project folder. Now, follow these steps:

1. Open the App.vue file in the src folder. In the <style> section of the single
file component, create a property called .rotate-enter-active,.rotate-leave-
active and define the transition CSS style property as transform .8s ease-
in-out;. Then, create a property called .rotate-enter,.rotate-leave-
active and define the transform CSS style property as rotate( -180deg ); and
transition as .8s ease-in-out;:

.rotate-enter-active,
.rotate-leave-active {
transition: transform .8s ease-in-out;
}

.rotate-enter,
.rotate-leave-active {
transform: rotate( -180deg );
transition: transform .8s ease-in-out;
}

2. In the <template> section of the single file component, wrap the img

HTML element with a Transition component. Then, define
the name attribute as rotate and the mode attribute as out-in:

<transition
name="rotate"
mode="out-in"
></transition>

3. Inside the Transition component, in the img HTML element, add a key

attribute and define it as up. Then, add another img HTML element and
add a v-else directive. Add a key attribute and define it as down, add an src
attribute and define it as "./assets/logo.png", and finally add a style
attribute and define it as "transform: rotate(180deg)":

<img
v-if="display"
key="up"
src="./assets/logo.png">
<img
v-else
key="down"
src="./assets/logo.png"
style="transform: rotate(180deg)"
>



When the user toggles the element, the leaving animation will be executed,
and then after it has finished, the entering animation will start with no delay.
This makes for a seamless transition between the old element and the new
one:

How it works...

The Transition component has a special attribute called mode, where it is
possible to define the behavior of the element's transition animation. This
behavior will create a set of rules that controls how the animation steps will
occur inside the Transition component. It's possible to use "in-out" or "out-in"
mode in the component:

In the "in-out" behavior, the new element transition will occur first, and
when it's finished, the old element transition will start.


In the "out-in" behavior, the old element transition will occur first, and
then the new element transition will start.

In our case, we created an animation that rotates the Vue logo upside down.
Then, to handle this seamless change, we used "out-in" mode so that the new
element will only show up after the old one has finished the transition.

Creating Beautiful Applications Using
UI Frameworks

Using UI frameworks and libraries is a good way to increase productivity
and help the development of your application. You can focus more on the
code and less on the design.

Learning how to use such frameworks means that you know how these
frameworks behave and work. This will help you in the process of
developing an application or a framework in the future.

Here, you will learn more about the usage of frameworks when creating user
registration forms and all the components that are needed for a page. In this
chapter, we will learn how to create a layout, a page, and a form using
Buefy, Vuetify, and Ant-Design.

In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:

Creating a page, a layout, and a user form with Buefy
Creating a page, a layout, and a user form with Vuetify
Creating a page, a layout, and a user form with Ant-Design

Technical requirements

In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue-CLI.

Attention Windows users: you need to install an npm package called windows-build-tools. To
do so, open PowerShell as administrator and execute the following command:
> npm install -g windows-build-tools

To install Vue-CLI, you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global


Creating a page, a layout, and a
user form with Buefy

Bulma was one of the first frameworks to be used for rapid prototyping and
web development that didn't require a JavaScript library attached to it. All
the special components that needed to be coded were the responsibility of
the developer using the framework.

With the advent of JavaScript frameworks and the community that was
created around the Bulma framework, a wrapper for Vue was created. This
wrapper takes all the responsibility of JavaScript component development
and delivers a complete solution for developers to use the Bulma framework
within their applications, without the need to re-invent the wheel.

In this recipe, we will learn how to use the Buefy framework with Vue and
how to create a layout, a page, and a user registration form.

Getting ready

The pre-requisites for this recipe are as follows:

Node.js 12+
A Vue-CLI project

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

To create a Vue-CLI project with the Buefy framework, we need to create a
Vue-CLI project first and then add the Buefy framework to the project. We
will divide this recipe into four parts: creating the Vue-CLI project, adding


the Buefy framework to the project, creating the layout and the page, and
finally creating the user registration form.

Creating the Vue-CLI project

Here we will create the Vue-CLI project to be used in this recipe. This
project will have custom settings to be able to work with the Buefy
framework:

1. We need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create bulma-vue

2. Vue-CLI will ask for you to choose a preset – select Manually select

features:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
default (babel, eslint)
❯ Manually select features

3. Now the Vue-CLI will ask for the features, and you will need to

select CSS Pre-processors as an additional feature on top of the default
ones:

? Check the features needed for your project: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Babel
TypeScript
Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
Router
Vuex
❯ CSS Pre-processors
❯ Linter / Formatter
Unit Testing
E2E Testing

4. Here the Vue-CLI will ask which CSS pre-processor you want to use;

select Sass/SCSS (with node-sass):

? Pick a CSS pre-processor (PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CSS Modules are
supported by default): (Use arrow keys)
Sass/SCSS (with dart-sass)
❯ Sass/SCSS (with node-sass)
Less
Stylus


5. Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatted. In our case,

we will select the ESLint + Airbnb config:

? Pick a linter / formatter config: (Use arrow keys)
ESLint with error prevention only
❯ ESLint + Airbnb config
ESLint + Standard config
ESLint + Prettier

6. Choose the additional features of the linter (here, Lint and fix on commit):

? Pick additional lint features: (Use arrow keys)
Lint on save
❯ Lint and fix on commit

7. Select where you want to place the linter and formatter configuration

files (here, In dedicated config files):

? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? (Use arrow
keys)
❯ In dedicated config files
In package.json

8. Finally, the Vue-CLI will ask you whether you want to save the settings
for future projects; you should select N. After that, Vue-CLI will create
the folder and install the dependencies for you:

? Save this as a preset for future projects? (y/N) n

Adding Buefy to the Vue-CLI project

To use Bulma in a Vue project, we are going to use the Buefy UI library.
This library is a wrapper around the Bulma framework and provides all the
components that are available with the original framework and some
additional components to use:

1. In the folder that you created for your Vue-CLI project, open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and
execute the following command:

> vue add buefy

2. Vue-CLI will ask whether you want to choose a style to work with

Buefy; we will go with scss:


? Add Buefy style? (Use arrow keys)
none
css
❯ scss

3. Then, Vue-CLI will ask whether you want to include the Material

Design icons; for this project, we won't use them:

? Include Material Design Icons? (y/N) n

4. Now Vue-CLI will ask whether you want to include Font Awesome

icons; we will add them to the project:

? Include Font Awesome Icons? (y/N) y

Creating the layout and a page with Buefy

To create a page, we need to create a layout structure and the base
components for the page, such as a header menu, a footer, and the hero
section of the page.

Creating the header menu component

In our design, we will have a header menu, with a basic combination of links
and call-to-action buttons:

1. Create a new file named top-menu.vue in the src/components folder and open

it.

2. In the <script> section of the single file component, we will export a
default JavaScript object, with the name property defined as TopMenu:

<script>
export default {
name: 'TopMenu',
};
</script>

3. In the <template> section of the single file component, create a section
HTML element with the section class, and add a child div HTML
element with the container class:


<section class="section">
<div class="container">
</div>
</section>

4. Now create a b-navbar component as a child of the div.container HTML
element, and add as a child a template placeholder component, with the
named slot as brand. Inside that, add a b-navbar-item component with the
href attribute defined as # and add an img HTML element as a child:

<b-navbar>
<template slot="brand">
<b-navbar-item href="#">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buefy/buefy/dev
/static/img/buefy-logo.png"
alt="Lightweight UI components for Vue.js based on Bulma"
>
</b-navbar-item>
</template>
</b-navbar>

5. After this template placeholder, create another template placeholder with
the named slot as start. Inside it, create two b-navbar-item components
with the href attribute defined as #. Create, as a sibling component, a b-
navbar-dropdown component with the label attribute defined as Info. In this
component, add two b-navbar-item components as children with the href
attribute defined as #:

<template slot="start">
<b-navbar-item href="#">
Home
</b-navbar-item>
<b-navbar-item href="#">
Documentation
</b-navbar-item>
<b-navbar-dropdown label="Info">
<b-navbar-item href="#">
About
</b-navbar-item>
<b-navbar-item href="#">
Contact
</b-navbar-item>
</b-navbar-dropdown>
</template>

6. Finally, create another template placeholder with the named slot as end.
Create a b-navbar-item component as a child component with the tag
attribute defined as div, and add a div HTML element as a child of this
component with the buttons class. In the div HTML element, create an a


HTML element with the button is-primary class, and another a HTML
element with the button is-light class:

<template slot="end">
<b-navbar-item tag="div">
<div class="buttons">
<a class="button is-primary">
<strong>Sign up</strong>
</a>
<a class="button is-light">
Log in
</a>
</div>
</b-navbar-item>
</template>

Creating the hero section component

We will create a hero section component. A hero component is a full-width
banner that provides visual information on the page to the user:

1. Create a new file named hero-section.vue in the src/components folder and

open it.

2. In the <script> section of the single file component, we will export

a default JavaScript object, with the name property defined as HeroSection:

<script>
export default {
name: 'HeroSection',
};
</script>

3. In the <template> section of the single file component, create a section
HTML element with the hero is-primary class, then add  a div HTML
element as a child, with the hero-body class:

<section class="hero is-primary">
<div class="hero-body">
</div>
</section>

4. Inside the div.hero-body HTML element, create a child div HTML

element with the container class. Then, add an h1 HTML element as a
child with the title class and an h2 HTML element with the
subtitle class:


<div class="container">
<h1 class="title">
user Registration
</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">
Main user registration form
</h2>
</div>

Creating the footer component

The final component that we are going to use in our layout is the footer
component. This will be displayed as the footer of our page:

1. Create a new file named Footer.vue in the src/components folder and open

it.

2. In the <script> section of the single file component, we will export

a default JavaScript object, with the name property defined as
FooterSection:

<script>
export default {
name: 'FooterSection',
};
</script>

3. In the <template> section of the single file component, create a footer

HTML element with the footer class, and then add a div HTML element
with the content has-text-centered class:

<footer class="footer">
<div class="content has-text-centered">
</div>
</footer>

4. Inside the div.content HTML element, create a p HTML element for the
initial footer line, and create a second p HTML element for the second
line:

<p>

</p>

Creating the layout component

To create the layout component, we are going to use all the created
components, and add a slot that will hold the page content:

1. Create a new folder called layouts in the src folder, and create a new file

named Main.vue and open it.

2. In the <script> section of the single file component, import the footer-

section component and the top-menu component:

import FooterSection from '../components/Footer.vue';
import TopMenu from '../components/top-menu.vue';

3. Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with

the name property defined as Mainlayout, and define the components property
with the imported components:

export default {
name: 'Mainlayout',
components: {
TopMenu,
FooterSection,
},
};

4. Finally, in the <template> section of the single file component, create a div
HTML element with the child top-menu component, a slot placeholder,
and the footer-section component:

<template>
<div>
<top-menu />
<slot/>
<footer-section />
</div>
</template>

Creating the user registration form with Buefy


Now we are going to create the user registration form and make the final
page. In this step, we will join the outputs of all the other steps into a single
page:

1. Open the App.vue file in the src folder. In the <script> section of the single

file component, import the main-layout component and the hero-
section component:

import Mainlayout from './layouts/main.vue';
import HeroSection from './components/heroSection.vue';

2. Then, we will export a default JavaScript object with the name property
defined as App, then define the components property with the imported
components. Add the data property to the JavaScript object, with the
name, username, password, email, phone, cellphone, address, zipcode, and country
properties:

export default {
name: 'App',
components: {
HeroSection,
Mainlayout,
},
data: () => ({
name: '',
username: '',
password: '',
email: '',
phone: '',
cellphone: '',
address: '',
zipcode: '',
country: '',
}),
};

3. In the <template> section of the single file, add the imported main-layout

component and add hero-section as a child component:

<template>
<main-layout>
<hero-section/>
</main-layout>
</template>

4. After the hero-section component, create a sibling section HTML

element, with the section class, and add a child div HTML element with


the container class. In this div HTML element, create a h1 HTML element
with the title is-3 class and a sibling hr HTML element:

<section class="section">
<div class="container">
<h1 class="title is-3">Personal Information</h1>
<hr/>
</div>
</section>

5. Then, create a b-field component as a sibling of the hr HTML element,
with Name for label, and add a child b-input with the v-model directive
bound to name. Do the same for the email field, changing label to Email,
and the v-model directive bound to email. In the email b-input, add a type
attribute defined as email:

<b-field label="Name">
<b-input
v-model="name"
/>
</b-field>
<b-field
label="Email"
>
<b-input
v-model="email"
type="email"
/>
</b-field>

6. Create a b-field component as a sibling of the b-field component, with
the grouped attribute. Then, as child components, create the following:

A b-field component with the expanded attribute and label defined as
Phone. Add a child b-input component with the v-model directive
bound to phone and type as tel.
A b-field component with the expanded attribute and label defined
as Cellphone. Add a child b-input component with the v-
model directive bound to cellphone and type as tel:

<b-field grouped>
<b-field
expanded
label="Phone"
>
<b-input
v-model="phone"
type="tel"
/>
</b-field>
<b-field


expanded
label="Cellphone"
>
<b-input
v-model="cellphone"
type="tel"
/>
</b-field>
</b-field>

7. Then, create an h1 HTML element as a sibling of the b-field component
with the title is-3 class, and add an hr HTML element as a sibling.
Create a b-field component with label defined as Address, and add a b-
input component with the v-model directive bound to address:

<h1 class="title is-3">Address</h1>
<hr/>
<b-field
label="Address"
>
<b-input
v-model="address"
/>
</b-field>

8. Create a b-field component as a sibling of the b-field component, with
the grouped attribute. Then, as child components, create the following:
A child b-field component with the expanded attribute and label
defined as Zipcode. Add a b-input component with the v-model
directive bound to zipcode and the type attribute defined as tel.
A child b-field component with the expanded attribute
and label defined as Country. Add a b-input component with the v-
model directive bound to country and the type attribute defined as tel:

<b-field grouped>
<b-field
expanded
label="Zipcode"
>
<b-input
v-model="zipcode"
type="tel"
/>
</b-field>
<b-field
expanded
label="Country"
>
<b-input
v-model="country"
/>


</b-field>
</b-field>

9. Then, create an h1 HTML element as a sibling of the b-field component,

with the title is-3 class, and add an hr HTML element as a
sibling. Create a b-field component with the grouped attribute. Create a
child b-field component with the expanded attribute and label defined
as username, and add a b-input component with the v-model directive bound
to username. Do the same for the Password input,
changing label to Password, in the b-input component defining the v-
model directive as bound to password, and adding the type attribute as
password:

<h1 class="title is-3">user Information</h1>
<hr/>
<b-field grouped>
<b-field
expanded
label="username"
>
<b-input
v-model="username"
/>
</b-field>
<b-field
expanded
label="Password"
>
<b-input
v-model="password"
type="password"
/>
</b-field>
</b-field>

10. Finally, create a b-field component as a sibling of the b-field component,
with the position attribute defined as is-right and the grouped attribute.
Then, create two div HTML element with the control class. In the first
div HTML element, add a button HTML element as a child with the
button is danger is-light class,  and in the second div HTML element,
create a child button HTML element with the button is-success class:

<b-field
position="is-right"
grouped
>
<div class="control">
<button class="button is-danger is-light">Cancel</button>
</div>
<div class="control">
<button class="button is-success">Submit</button>


</div>
</b-field>

How it works...

First, we create a Vue-CLI project, with the basic configurations, and the
additional CSS pre-processor node-sass. Then, we were able to add the Buefy
framework to our project, using Vue-CLI and the Buefy plugin. Using the
Buefy framework, we created a layout page component, with a header menu
component and a footer component.

For the page, we used the Bulma CSS container structure to define our page,
and place our user registration form on a default grid size. Then, we
added the hero section component, for the page identification, and finally,
we created the user registration form and inputs.

Here is a screenshot of the final project up and running:

Creating a page, a layout, and a
user form with Vuetify

Vuetify is on the top three list of the most well-known UI frameworks for
Vue. Based on Material Design by Google, this framework was initially
designed by John Leider and is now gathering ground in the Vue ecosystem
as the go-to UI framework for the initial development of an application.

In this recipe, we will learn how to use Vuetify to create a layout component
wrapper, a page, and a user registration form.

Getting ready

The pre-requisites for this recipe are as follows:

Node.js 12+
A Vue-CLI project

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

We will divide this recipe into four main sections. The first and second
sections are dedicated to the creation of the project and the installation of the
framework and the last two sections are dedicated to the creation of the user
registration page and the components needed to create it.

Creating the Vue-CLI project

To use Vuetify with a Vue-CLI project, we need to create a custom Vue-CLI
project with pre-defined configurations, so that we are able to take full


advantage of the framework and the styling options it provides:

1. We need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create vue-vuetify

2. First, Vue-CLI will ask for you to choose a preset; select Manually select

features using the space bar:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
default (babel, eslint)
❯ Manually select features

3. Now Vue-CLI will ask for the features, and you will need to select CSS

Pre-processors as an additional feature on top of the default ones:

? Check the features needed for your project: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Babel
TypeScript
Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
Router
Vuex
❯ CSS Pre-processors
❯ Linter / Formatter
Unit Testing
E2E Testing

4. Here, Vue-CLI will ask which CSS pre-processor you want to use;

select Sass/SCSS (with node-sass):

? Pick a CSS pre-processor (PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CSS Modules
are supported by default): (Use arrow keys)
Sass/SCSS (with dart-sass)
❯ Sass/SCSS (with node-sass)
Less
Stylus

5. Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatted. In our case,

we will select the ESLint + Airbnb config:

? Pick a linter / formatter config: (Use arrow keys)
ESLint with error prevention only
❯ ESLint + Airbnb config
ESLint + Standard config
ESLint + Prettier

6. Choose the additional features of the linter (here, Lint and fix on commit):


? Pick additional lint features: (Use arrow keys)
Lint on save
❯ Lint and fix on commit

7. Select where you want to place the linter and formatter configuration

files (here, In dedicated config files):

? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? (Use arrow
keys)
❯ In dedicated config files
In package.json

8. Finally, Vue-CLI will ask you whether you want to save the settings for

future projects; you will select N. After that, Vue-CLI will create a
folder and install the dependencies for you:

? Save this as a preset for future projects? (y/N) n

Adding Vuetify to the Vue-CLI project

To use Vuetify in a Vue project, we will use the Vue-CLI plugin installation
of the framework:

1. In the folder that you created your Vue-CLI project in, open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and
execute the following command:

> vue add vuetify

2. Vue-CLI will ask whether you want to choose an installation preset.

Choose the default preset. Then, Vue-CLI will finish the installation of
the framework on the project:

? Choose a preset: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Default (recommended)
Prototype (rapid development)
Configure (advanced)

3. After the installation is finished, Vuetify will have configured the files
inside your project to load the framework. Now you are ready to use it.

Creating the layout with Vuetify


Using Vuetify as the UI framework, we are using the Material Design guide
as a base, because by using Material Design, we can follow a design
guideline to create our design structure, which will mean a more appealing
structure. You can find the Material Design guidelines at https://material.io/de
sign/introduction#goals.

Creating the top bar component

In this part, we will create the top-bar component that will be used in the
layout of our page:

1. In the src/components folder, create a file named TopBar.vue and open it.
2. In the <script> section of the single file component, we will export
a default JavaScript object, with the name property defined as TopBar:

<script>
export default {
name: 'TopBar',
};
</script>

3. Inside the <template> section, create a v-app-bar component with the

app,  dark, and dense attributes defined as true, and the color
attribute defined as primary:

<v-app-bar
color="primary"
app
dark
dense
></v-app-bar>

4. Inside the component, create a v-app-bar-nav-icon component with an

event listener on the click event, sending an event 'open-drawer' when the
button is clicked:

<v-app-bar-nav-icon
@click="$emit('open-drawer')"
/>

5. Finally, as a sibling of the v-app-bar-nav-icon component, add a v-toolbar-

title component with the title of the page or application:

<v-toolbar-title>Vue.JS 3 Cookbook - Packt</v-toolbar-title>


Creating the drawer menu component

Inside a Material Design application, we have a drawer menu that pops up
over the page. This menu will be opened when the user clicks on the button
we have just created in the TopBar component:

1. In the src/components folder, create a file named DrawerMenu.vue and open it.
2. In the <script> section of the single file component, we will export

a default JavaScript object with three properties:
The name property, defined as DrawerMenu.
The props property, defined as a JavaScript object, with a property
called value. This property will be another JavaScript object, with
the type, required, and default properties. The type property is defined
as Boolean, the required property as true, and the default property as
false.
The data property, as a singleton function returning a JavaScript
object. This object will have a menu property, which we will define
as an array of the menu items that will be used. The array will
contain Javascript objects with the name, then link, and
icon properties. The first menu item will have name defined as Home,
then link defined as #, and icon defined as mdi-home. The second
menu item will have name defined as Contact, then link defined as #,
and icon defined as mdi-email. Finally, the third menu item will
have name defined as Vuetify, then link defined as #, and icon defined
as mdi-vuetify:

<script>
export default {
name: 'DrawerMenu',
props: {
value: {
type: Boolean,
required: true,
default: false,
},
},
data: () => ({
menu: [
{
name: 'Home',
link: '#',
icon: 'mdi-home',
},
{
name: 'Contact',


link: '#',
icon: 'mdi-email',
},
{
name: 'Vuetify',
link: '#',
icon: 'mdi-vuetify',
},
],
}),
};
</script>

3. In the <template> section, create a v-navigation-drawer component with the
value attribute as a variable attribute bound to the value props, the app
attribute defined as true, and the event listener on the
click event, sending an 'input' event:

<v-navigation-drawer
:value="value"
app
@input="$emit('input', $event)"
></v-navigation-drawer>

4. Create a v-list component with the dense attribute defined as true. As a
child element, create a v-list-item component and define the following:

The v-for directive iterating over the menu items.
The key attribute with index of the item menu.
The link attribute defined as true.
Inside v-list-item, create v-list-item-action with a VIcon child, with
the inner text as item.icon.
Create, as a sibling of v-list-item-action, a v-list-item-
content component with v-list-item-title as a child element,
with item.name as the inner text:

<v-list dense>
<v-list-item
v-for="(item, index) in menu"
:key="index"
link>
<v-list-item-action>
<v-icon>{{ item.icon }}</v-icon>
</v-list-item-action>
<v-list-item-content>
<v-list-item-title>{{ item.name }}</v-list-item-
title>
</v-list-item-content>
</v-list-item>
</v-list>


Creating the layout component

To create the layout component, we are going to use all the created
components and add a slot that will hold the page content:

1. In the src/components folder, create a new file named Layout.vue and open

it.

2. In the <script> section of the single file component, import the top-

bar component and the drawer-menu component:

import TopBar from './TopBar.vue';
import DrawerMenu from './DrawerMenu.vue';

3. Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with

the name property defined as Layout, then create the components property
with the imported components. Finally, add the data property as a
singleton function returning a JavaScript object, with the drawer property
with the value defined as false:

export default {
name: 'Layout',
components: {
DrawerMenu,
TopBar,
},
data: () => ({
drawer: false,
}),
};

4. Inside the <template> section, create a v-app component. As the first child,
add the top-bar component, with the event listener on the open-drawer
event listener, changing the drawer data property as the negation of
the drawer property. Then, as a sibling of top-bar, create a drawer-menu
component with the v-model directive bound to drawer. Finally, create a v-
content component with a child <slot> element:

<template>
<v-app>
<top-bar
@open-drawer="drawer = !drawer"
/>
<drawer-menu
v-model="drawer"
/>
<v-content>
<slot/>


</v-content>
</v-app>
</template>

Creating the user registration form with Vuetify

Now, with the layout component ready, we will create the user registration
form. Because Vuetify has built-in validation in forms, we will be using that
to validate some fields in our form.

Single file component <script> section

Here, we will create the <script> section of the single file component:

1. In the src folder, open the App.vue file and clear its contents.
2. Import the layout component:

import Layout from './components/Layout.vue';

3. Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with a

name property defined as App, then define the components property with the
imported component. Define the computed and methods properties as an
empty JavaScript object. Then create a data property defined as a
singleton function returning a JavaScript object. In the data property,
create the following:

A valid property with the value defined as false;
A name, username, password, email, phone, cellphone, address, zipcode, and
country properties defined as empty strings:

export default {
name: 'App',

components: {
Layout,
},

data: () => ({
valid: true,
name: '',
username: '',
password: '',
email: '',
phone: '',
cellphone: '',
address: '',
zipcode: '',




country: '',
}),
computed: {},
methods: {},
};

4. In the computed property, create a property called nameRules; this property is

a function that returns an array, with an anonymous function that
receives a value and returns the verification of the value or the error
text. Do the same for the passwordRules and emailRules properties. In the
emailRules property, add another anonymous function to the returned
array that checks whether the value is a valid email through a regular
expression, and if the value is not a valid email it returns the error
message:

computed: {
nameRules() {
return [
(v) => !!v || 'Name is required',
];
},
passwordRules() {
return [
(v) => !!v || 'Password is required',
];
},
emailRules() {
return [
(v) => !!v || 'E-mail is required',
(v) => /.+@.+\..+/.test(v) || 'E-mail must be valid',
];
},
},

5. Finally, inside the methods property, create a new property named

register that is a function that calls the $refs.form.validate function. Also,
create another property named cancel that is another function that calls
the $refs.form.reset function:

methods: {
register() {
this.$refs.form.validate();
},
cancel() {
this.$refs.form.reset();
},
},

Single file component <template> section


It's time to create the <template> section of the single file component:

1. In the src folder, open the App.vue file.
2. In the <template> section, create a layout component element, and add a v-
container component as a child with the fluid attribute defined as true:

<layout>
<v-container
fluid
>
</v-container>
</layout>

3. Inside the v-container component, create a child HTML h1 element with

the page title and a sibling v-subheader component with the page
description:

<h1>user Registration</h1>
<v-subheader>Main user registration form</v-subheader>

4. After that, create a v-form component with the ref attribute defined as

form and the lazy-validation attribute as true. Then, the v-model directive of
the component gets bound to the valid variable. Create a child v-container
component with the fluid attribute defined as true:

<v-form
ref="form"
v-model="valid"
lazy-validation
>
<v-container
fluid
>
</v-container>
</v-form>

5. Inside the v-container component, create a v-row component, and then add
a v-col component as a child with the cols attribute defined as 12. Inside
the v-col component, create a v-card component with the outlined
attribute and flat defined as true, and class defined as mx-auto:

<v-row>
<v-col
cols="12"
>
<v-card
outlined
flat
class="mx-auto"


>
</v-card>
</v-col>
</v-row>

6. As a child element of the v-card component, create a v-card-title

component with the card title, then as a sibling element create a v-
divider component. After that, create a v-container element with the fluid
attribute defined as true. Inside the v-container element, create a child v-
row component:

<v-card-title>
Personal Information
</v-card-title>
<v-divider/>
<v-container
fluid
>
<v-row>
</v-row>
</v-container>

7. Inside the v-row component, create a child v-col element with

the cols attribute defined as 12. Then inside the v-col component,
create v-text-field with the v-model directive bound to the name variable,
the rules variable attribute defined as the nameRules computed property,
the label attribute defined as Name, and finally, the required
attribute defined as true:

<v-col
cols="12"
>
<v-text-field
v-model="name"
:rules="nameRules"
label="Name"
required
/>
</v-col>

8. As a sibling of the v-col component, create another v-col component

with the cols attribute defined as 12. Then, add the v-text-field
component as a child, with the v-model directive bound to the email
variable, the rules variable attribute defined as the emailRules computed
property, the type attribute as email, the label attribute as E-mail, and
finally, the required attribute defined as true:


<v-col
cols="12"
>
<v-text-field
v-model="email"
:rules="emailRules"
type="email"
label="E-mail"
required
/>
</v-col>

9. Create a v-col component as a sibling of the v-col component, and define
the cols attribute as 6. Then, add as a child component the v-text-field
component, with the v-model directive bound to the phone variable and the
label attribute defined as Phone. Do the same for the Cellphone input; you
must change the v-model directive bound to the cellphone variable and the
label to Cellphone:

<v-col
cols="6"
>
<v-text-field
v-model="phone"
label="Phone"
/>
</v-col>
<v-col
cols="6"
>
<v-text-field
v-model="cellphone"
label="Cellphone"
/>
</v-col>

10. Now we will create the Address card, as a sibling of v-col in the v-row

component. Create a v-col component with the cols attribute defined as
12. Inside the v-col component, create a v-card component with the
outlined attribute and flat defined as true, and class defined as mx-auto. As
a child element of the v-card component, create a v-card-title component
with the card title; then, as a sibling element, create a v-
divider component. After that, create a v-container element with
the fluid attribute defined as true. Inside the v-container element, create a
child v-row component:

<v-col
cols="12"
>
<v-card
outlined


flat
class="mx-auto"
>
<v-card-title>
Address
</v-card-title>
<v-divider/>
<v-container
fluid
>
<v-row>
</v-row>
</v-container>
</v-card>
</v-col>

11. Inside the v-row component in the v-container component, create a v-col
component with the cols attribute defined as 12. Then, add  v-text-field
as a child component with the v-model directive bound to the address
variable and the label attribute defined as Address:

<v-col
cols="12"
>
<v-text-field
v-model="address"
label="Address"
/>
</v-col>

12. As a sibling element, create a v-col component with the cols attribute

defined as 6. Add a v-text-field component as a child. Define the v-model
directive of the v-text-field component bound to the zipcode variable and
the label attribute defined as Zipcode:

<v-col
cols="6"
>
<v-text-field
v-model="zipcode"
label="Zipcode"
/>
</v-col>

13. Then, create a v-col component with the cols attribute defined as 6. Add
a v-text-field component as a child with the v-model directive bound to
the country variable and the label attribute defined as Country:

<v-col
cols="6"
>
<v-text-field


v-model="country"
label="Country"
/>
</v-col>

14. Now we will create the user Information card as a sibling of v-col in the v-
row component. Create a v-col component with the cols attribute defined
as 12. Inside the v-col component, create a v-card component with the
outlined attribute and flat defined as true, and class defined as mx-auto. As
a child element of the v-card component, create a v-card-title component
with the card title; then, as a sibling element, create a v-
divider component. After that, create a v-container element with
the fluid attribute defined as true. Inside the v-container element, create a
child v-row component:

<v-col
cols="12"
>
<v-card
outlined
flat
class="mx-auto"
>
<v-card-title>
user Information
</v-card-title>
<v-divider/>
<v-container
fluid
>
<v-row>
</v-row>
</v-container>
</v-card>
</v-col>

15. Inside the v-row component in the v-container component, create a v-
col component with the cols attribute defined as 6. Then, add  v-text-
field as a child component with the v-model directive bound to
the username variable and the label attribute defined as username:

<v-col
cols="6"
>
<v-text-field
v-model="username"
label="username"
/>
</v-col>


16. As a sibling create a v-col component with the cols attribute defined as 6,
and add a v-text-field component as a child with the v-model directive
bound to the password variable, the rules variable attribute defined as the
passwordRules computed property, and the label attribute defined
as Password:

<v-col
cols="6"
>
<v-text-field
v-model="password"
:rules="passwordRules"
label="Password"
type="password"
required
/>
</v-col>

17. Now we will create the action buttons. As a sibling of the v-col on the
top v-row component, create a v-col component with the cols attribute
defined as 12 and the class attribute defined as text-right. Inside the v-col
component, create a v-btn component with the color attribute defined as
error, the class attribute as mr-4, and the click event listener attached to
the cancel method. Finally, create a v-btn component as a sibling, with
the disabled variable attribute as the negation of the valid variable, the
color attribute as success, the class attribute as mr-4, and the  click event
listener attached to the register method:

<v-col
cols="12"
class="text-right"
>
<v-btn
color="error"
class="mr-4"
@click="cancel"
>
Cancel
</v-btn>
<v-btn
:disabled="!valid"
color="success"
class="mr-4"
@click="register"
>
Register
</v-btn>
</v-col>


How it works...

In this recipe, we learned how to create a user registration page with Vuetify
and Vue-CLI. To create this page, we first needed to create the project using
the Vue-CLI tool and then add the Vuetify plugin to it, so that the framework
was available to be used.

Then, we created the top-bar component, which holds the application title and
the menu button toggle. To use the menu, we created the drawer-menu
component to hold the navigation items. Finally, we created the layout
component to hold together the top-bar and drawer-menu components and added
a <slot> component to place the page content.

For the user registration form page, we created three cards that hold the input
forms, which were bound to the variables on the component. Some of the
inputs on the form are attached to a set of validation rules that checks for
required fields and email validation.

Finally, the user registration form is checked to see whether it's valid before
sending the data to the server.

Here is a screenshot of the final project up and running:

Creating a page, a layout, and a
user form with Ant-Design

The Ant-Design framework was created by the AliBaba group, specifically
by the tech team behind AliPay and Ant Financial. It's an ecosystem design
that is being mainly used by Asian tech giants and it has a large presence in
the React and Vue communities. Focused on the back office UI, the main
core of the framework is its solutions for custom data inputs and data tables.

Here, we will learn how to create a user registration form using the Ant-
Design and Vue, by creating a top bar component, a drawer menu, a layout
wrapper, and a user registration page with a form.

Getting ready

The pre-requisites for this recipe are as follows:

Node.js 12+
A Vue-CLI project

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...


In this recipe, we will create a user registration form using the Ant-Design
framework. To do so, we will create a layout wrapper and the components
needed for the wrapper, and finally, we will create the page that will hold the
user registration form.

Creating the Vue-CLI project

We need to create a Vue-CLI project to be able to install the Ant-Design
plugin and start developing the user registration form:

1. We need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create antd-vue

2. First, Vue-CLI will ask for you to choose a preset; select Manually select

features using the space bar:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
default (babel, eslint)
❯ Manually select features

3. Now Vue-CLI will ask for the features, and you will need to select CSS

Pre-processors as an additional feature on top of the default ones:

? Check the features needed for your project: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Babel
TypeScript
Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
Router
Vuex
❯ CSS Pre-processors
❯ Linter / Formatter
Unit Testing
E2E Testing

4. Here, Vue-CLI will ask which CSS pre-processor you want to use;

select Less:

? Pick a CSS pre-processor (PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CSS Modules
are supported by default): (Use arrow keys)
Sass/SCSS (with dart-sass)
Sass/SCSS (with node-sass)
❯ Less
Stylus


5. Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatted. In our case,

we will select ESLint + Airbnb config:

? Pick a linter / formatter config: (Use arrow keys)
ESLint with error prevention only
❯ ESLint + Airbnb config
ESLint + Standard config
ESLint + Prettier

6. Choose the additional features of the linter (here, Lint on save):

? Pick additional lint features: (Use arrow keys)
Lint on save
❯ Lint and fix on commit

7. Select where you want to place the linter and formatter configuration

files (here, In dedicated config files):

? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? (Use
arrow keys)
❯ In dedicated config files
In package.json

8. Finally, the CLI will ask you whether you want to save the settings for
future projects; you should select N. After that, Vue-CLI will create a
folder and install the dependencies for you:

? Save this as a preset for future projects? (y/N) n

Adding Ant-Design to the Vue-CLI project

To add the Ant-Design framework to a Vue-CLI project, we need to use the
Vue-CLI plugin to install the framework as a project dependency and have it
available in the global scope of the application:

1. In the folder that you created your Vue-CLI project in, open Terminal
(macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and
execute the following command:

> vue add ant-design

2. Vue-CLI will ask you how the import of the Ant-Design component

should occur; we will select the Fully import option:


? How do you want to import Ant-Design-Vue?
❯ Fully import
Import on demand

3. Vue-CLI will ask you whether you want to overwrite the Ant-Design

LESS variables; we will choose N:

? Do you wish to overwrite Ant-Design-Vue's LESS variables? (y/N)

4. Finally, Vue-CLI will ask about the main language Ant-Design will use

in the project; we will select en_US:

? Choose the locale you want to load
❯ en_US
zh_CN
zh_TW
en_GB
es_ES
ar_EG
bg_BG
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)

Creating the layout with Ant-Design

To be able to create a user registration form, we will create a base layout that
will wrap the page content and the form. Here, we will create the top-bar
component, the drawer-menu component, and the layout wrapper.

Creating the top-bar component

In the layout wrapper, we will have a top-bar component that will hold the
breadcrumbs for where the user currently is. Now we will create the top-bar
component and make it available for the layout:

1. In the src/components folder, create a new file called TopBar.vue and open it.
2. In the <script> section of the single file component, we will export
a default JavaScript object, with a name property defined as TopBar:

<script>
export default {
name: 'TopBar',
};
</script>


3. In the <style> section of the single file component, we will make the

<style> section scoped and create a class named header-bread.
Now, background-color will be defined as #f0f2f5 with a class named bread-
menu with the margin defined as 16px 0:

<style scoped>
.header-bread {
background-color: #f0f2f5;
}

.bread-menu {
margin: 16px 0;
}
</style>

4. In the <template> section of the single file component, we will create an
a-layout-component component with the class attribute defined as header-
bread. Also, add an a-breadcrumb component as a child element with the
class attribute as bread-menu:

<template>
<a-layout-header class="header-bread">
<a-breadcrumb class="bread-menu">
</a-breadcrumb>
</a-layout-header>
</template>

5. As a child of the a-breadcrumb component, create two a-breadcrumb-item

components and add to each the directions for the user's location. In our
case, the first one will be user and the second Registration Form:

<a-breadcrumb-item>user</a-breadcrumb-item>
<a-breadcrumb-item>Registration Form</a-breadcrumb-item>

Creating the drawer menu

In the layout design, we will have a drawer menu component as a navigation
menu for the user. Here we will create the Drawer component:

1. In the src/components folder, create a file named Drawer.vue and open it.

2. In the <script> section of the single file component, we will export

a default JavaScript object with two properties. The
name property, defined as Drawer, and the data property, as



a singleton function returning a JavaScript object. In the data property,
create the following:

A drawer property defined as false.
A menu property, which we will define as an array of the menu
items that will be used. The menu array will have three JavaScript
objects with the name and icon properties. This array will have:

A JavaScript object with the properties name defined as
Home and icon defined as home
A JavaScript object with the properties name defined as Ant
Design Vue and icon defined as ant-design
A JavaScript object with the properties name defined as
Contact and icon defined as mail:

<script>
export default {
name: 'Drawer',
data: () => ({
drawer: false,
menu: [
{
name: 'Home',
icon: 'home',
},
{
name: 'Ant Design Vue',
icon: 'ant-design',
},
{
name: 'Contact',
icon: 'mail',
},
],
}),
};
</script>

3. In the <template> section of the single file component, create an a-layout-
sider component, with the v-model directive bound to the drawer variable
and the collapsible attribute defined as true. As a child, create a a-menu
component with the default-selected-keys variable attribute defined as
['1'], the theme attribute defined as dark, and the mode attribute as inline:

<template>
<a-layout-sider
v-model="drawer"
collapsible
>
<a-menu
:default-selected-keys="['1']"
theme="dark"


mode="inline"
>
</a-menu>
</a-layout-sider>
</template>

4. Finally, inside the a-menu component, create an a-menu-item component,
with the v-for directive iterating over the menu variable, and create
the item and index temporary variables. Then, define the key variable
attribute as index. Create a child AIcon component with the type variable
attribute as item.icon with a sibling span HTML element and the content
as item.name:

<a-menu-item
v-for="(item,index) in menu"
:key="index"
>
<a-icon
:type="item.icon"
/>
<span>{{ item.name }}</span>
</a-menu-item>

Creating the layout component

Here, we will create the layout component. This component will join together
the top-bar component and the Drawer menu component to make a wrapper for
the user registration page:

1. In the src/components folder, create a new file named Layout.vue and open

it.

2. In the <script> section of the single file component, import the top-

bar component and the drawer-menu component:

import TopBar from './TopBar.vue';
import Drawer from './Drawer.vue';

3. Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with a name property,

defined as layout. Then define the components property with the imported
components.

export default {
name: 'layout',
components: {
Drawer,


TopBar,
},
};

4. In the <template> section of the single file component, create an a-layout

component with the style attribute defined as min-height: 100vh. Then, add
the Drawer component as a child. As a sibling of the drawer component,
create an a-layout component:

<template>
<a-layout
style="min-height: 100vh"
>
<drawer />
<a-layout>
<top-bar />
<a-layout-content style="margin: 0 16px">
<div style="padding: 24px; background: #fff;
min-height: auto;">
<slot />
</div>
</a-layout-content>
<a-layout-footer style="text-align: center">
Vue.js 3 Cookbook | Ant Design ©2020 Created by Ant UED
</a-layout-footer>
</a-layout>
</a-layout>
</template>

5. To the a-layout component, add the top-bar component and a sibling a-

layout-content component with the style attribute defined as margin: 0 16px.
As a child of that component, create a div HTML element with the style
attribute defined as padding: 24px; background: #fff; min-height: auto;, and
add a slot placeholder. Finally, create an a-layout-footer component with
the style attribute defined as text-align:center; with the footer text of the
page:

<top-bar />
<a-layout-content style="margin: 0 16px">
<div style="padding: 24px; background: #fff; min-height: auto;">
<slot />
</div>
</a-layout-content>
<a-layout-footer style="text-align: center">
Vue.js 3 Cookbook | Ant Design ©2020 Created by Ant UED
</a-layout-footer>

Creating the user registration form with Ant-Design


Now we will create the user registration page and form that will be placed
inside the layout that was created in the preceding steps.

Single file component <script> section

Here we will create the <script> section of the single file component:

1. In the src folder, open the App.vue file and clear its contents.
2. Import the layout component:

import Layout from './components/Layout.vue';

3. Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with

the name property defined as App, define the components property with the
imported component, and finally define the data property as a singleton
function returning a JavaScript object. In the data property, create the
following:

A labelCol property defined as a JavaScript object, with the span
property and the value 4.
A wrapperCol property defined as a JavaScript object, with the span
property and the value 14.
A form property defined as a JavaScript object, with the name,
username, password, email, phone, cellphone, address, zipcode, and country
properties all defined as empty strings:

export default {
name: 'App',
components: {
Layout,
},
data() {
return {
labelCol: { span: 4 },
wrapperCol: { span: 14 },
form: {
name: '',
username: '',
password: '',
email: '',
phone: '',
cellphone: '',
address: '',
zipcode: '',
country: '',
},
};


},
};

Single file component <template> section

It's time to create the <template> section of the single file component:

1. In the src folder, open the App.vue file.
2. In the <template> section, create a layout component element and add

an a-form-model component as a child with the model variable
attribute bound to form, the label-col variable attribute bound to labelCol,
and the wrapper-col variable attribute bound to wrapperCol:

<layout>
<a-form-model
:model="form"
:label-col="labelCol"
:wrapper-col="wrapperCol"
>
</a-form-model>
</layout>

3. Then, as a sibling of the layout component, create an h1 HTML element
with the page title User Registration, and a p HTML element with the Main
user registration form page subtitle. Then, create an a-card element with
the title attribute defined as Personal Information:

<h1>
User Registration
</h1>
<p>Main user registration form</p>
<a-card title="Personal Information"></a-card>

4. In the a-card component, create an a-form-model-item component as a child
element with the label attribute defined as Name, and add a child a-input
component with the v-model directive bound to the form.name variable:

<a-form-model-item label="Name">
<a-input v-model="form.name" />
</a-form-model-item>

5. Next, as a sibling, create an a-form-model-item component with the

label attribute defined as Email and add a child a-input component with
the v-model directive bound to the form.email variable and the type attribute
defined as email:


<a-form-model-item label="Email">
<a-input
v-model="form.email"
type="email"
/>
</a-form-model-item>

6. Create an element an a-form-model-item component with the

label attribute defined as Phone, and add a child a-input component with
the v-model directive bound to the form.phone variable:

<a-form-model-item label="Phone">
<a-input v-model="form.phone" />
</a-form-model-item>

7. Create an a-form-model-item component with the label attribute defined

as Cellphone, and add a child a-input component with the v-model directive
bound to the form.cellphone variable:

<a-form-model-item label="Cellphone">
<a-input v-model="form.cellphone" />
</a-form-model-item>

8. As a sibling of the a-card component, create an a-card component with
the title attribute defined as Address and the style attribute as margin-top:
16px;. Then, add a child a-form-model-item component with the
label attribute defined as Address, and add a child a-input component with
the v-model directive bound to the form.address variable:

<a-card title="Address" style="margin-top: 16px">
<a-form-model-item label="Address">
<a-input v-model="form.address" />
</a-form-model-item>
</a-card>

9. Next, as a sibling of the a-card component, create an a-form-model-

item component with the label attribute defined as Zipcode, and add a
child a-input component with the v-model directive bound to
the form.zipcode variable:

<a-form-model-item label="Zipcode">
<a-input v-model="form.zipcode" />
</a-form-model-item>

10. Create an a-form-model-item component with the label attribute defined as
Country, and add a child a-input component with the v-model directive


bound to the form.country variable:

<a-form-model-item label="Country">
<a-input v-model="form.country" />
</a-form-model-item>

11. As a sibling of the a-card component, create an a-card component with
the title attribute defined as User Information and the style attribute
as margin-top: 16px;. Then, add a child a-form-model-item component with
the label attribute defined as username, and add a child a-input component
with the v-model directive bound to the form.username variable:

<a-card title="user Information" style="margin-top: 16px">
<a-form-model-item label="username">
<a-input v-model="form.username" />
</a-form-model-item>
</a-card>

12. Create an a-form-model-item component with the label attribute defined
as Password, and add a child a-input-password component with the v-
model directive bound to the form.password variable, the visibility-toggle
attribute defined as true, and the type attribute defined as password:

<a-form-model-item label="Password">
<a-input-password
v-model="form.password"
visibility-toggle
type="password"
/>
</a-form-model-item>

13. Finally, as a sibling of the a-card component, create a-form-model-item with
the wrapper-col variable attribute defined as a JavaScript object, {span: 14,
offset: 4}. Then, add a child a-button with type defined as primary with the
text Create and another a-button with the style attribute defined as margin-
left: 10px; and the text Cancel:

<a-form-model-item :wrapper-col="{ span: 14, offset: 4 }">
<a-button type="primary">
Create
</a-button>
<a-button style="margin-left: 10px;">
Cancel
</a-button>
</a-form-model-item>

How it works...


In this recipe, we learned how to create a user registration page with Ant-
Design and Vue-CLI. To create this page, we first needed to create a project
using Vue-CLI and add the Ant-Design of Vue plugin to it, so that the
framework was available to be used.

Then, we created the top-bar component, which holds the navigation
breadcrumbs. For user navigation, we created a custom Drawer component
that has an inline toggle button at the bottom. Finally, we created
the layout component to hold together both the components and we added
a <slot> component to place the page content.

Finally, we created the user registration form page, with three cards that hold
the input forms that are bound to the variables on the component.

Here is a screenshot of the final project up and running:

Deploying an Application to Cloud
Platforms

Now it's time to deploy your application to the World Wide Web and make it
available to everyone across the globe.

In this chapter, we will learn how to do it with three different hosting
platforms – Netlify, Now, and Firebase. Here, we will learn the process of
creating the account on each platform, setting up the environment,
configuring the application for deployment, and finally deploying it to the
web.

In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:

Creating a Netlify account
Preparing your application for deployment in Netlify
Preparing for automatic deployment on Netlify with GitHub
Creating a Vercel account
Configuring the Vercel-CLI and deploying your project
Preparing for automatic deployment on Vercel with GitHub
Creating a Firebase project
Configuring the Firebase-CLI and deploying your project

Technical requirements

In this chapter, we will be using Node.js and Vue-CLI.

Attention Windows Users! You need to install an NPM package called windows-build-
tools in order to be able to install the following requisite packages. To do this, open
PowerShell as the administrator and execute the following command: > npm install -g
windows-build-tools

To install Vue-CLI, you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:


> npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global

Creating a Vue project

To create a Vue-CLI project, follow these steps:

1. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create vue-project

2. Vue-CLI will ask for you to choose a preset; select Manually select

features using the spacebar:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
default (babel, eslint)
❯ Manually select features

3. Now, Vue-CLI will ask for the features, and you will need to select

Router, Vuex, and Linter / Formatter as an additional feature on top of the
default ones:

? Check the features needed for your project: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Babel
TypeScript
Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
❯ Router
❯ Vuex
CSS Pre-processors
❯ Linter / Formatter
Unit Testing
E2E Testing

4. Now, Vue-CLI will ask whether you want to use history mode for route

management. We will choose y (yes):

? Use history mode for router? (Requires proper server setup for
index fallback in production) (Y/n) y

5. Continue the process by selecting the linter and formatter. We will

select ESLint + Airbnb config:

? Pick a linter / formatter config: (Use arrow keys)
ESLint with error prevention only
❯ ESLint + Airbnb config
ESLint + Standard config
ESLint + Prettier


6. Choose the additional features of the linter (here, Lint and fix on commit):

? Pick additional lint features: (Use arrow keys)
Lint on save
❯ Lint and fix on commit

7. Select where you want to place the linter and formatter configuration

files (here, In dedicated config files):

? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? (Use arrow
keys)
❯ In dedicated config files
In package.json

8. Finally, the CLI will ask you whether you want to save the settings for
future projects; you will select N. After that, Vue-CLI will create the
folder and install the dependencies for you:

? Save this as a preset for future projects? (y/N) n

Creating a Netlify account

It's time to start the deployment process to the Netlify platform. In this
recipe, we will learn how to create our Netlify account so that we can deploy
our application to the web.

Getting ready

The prerequisites for this recipe are as follows:

An email address
A GitHub account
A GitLab account
A BitBucket account

In the process of creating an account on Netlify, you can do this with an
email address, a GitHub account, a GitLab account, or a BitBucket
account.


How to do it...

Here, we will learn how to create a Netlify account with an email address:

1. Go to the Netlify website at https://www.netlify.com/ and click on Sign

up → in the header menu. You will be redirected to the initial Sign up
page.

2. On this page, you can select the method that you want to use to sign up
to Netlify. In this process, we will continue with the email address.
Click on the Email button to be redirected to the Email Sign up form.

3. Fill in the form with your email address and a password of your

choosing. There is a password rule of 8 characters minimum. After
completing the form, click on the Sign up button. From there, you will
be redirected to the Success page.

4. Now, you will receive a verification email in your inbox that you need
in order to continue using the Netlify platform. To continue, open your
email inbox and check the Netlify email.

5. In your email inbox, open the Netlify email and then click on the Verify
email button. At this point, a new window will open, and you will be
able to log in with the recently registered email and password.

6. Here, you can complete the login form with your email address and the
password you chose at step 3. After that, click on the Log in button to
be redirected to the main window of the Netlify platform.

7. Finally, you will find yourself at the main screen of the Netlify

platform, with a blank page to begin deployment on the platform.

How it works...

In this recipe, we learned how to create our account on Netlify. We saw that
it is possible to do this with various OAuth methods and the basic email that
we used in the recipe.

The email address creation process involves defining the email address that
will be used and a password for the account, verifying the account email.
Then, you can log in to the platform.

Preparing your application for
deployment in Netlify

To start the deployment process, we need to configure our project to have a
valid Netlify deployment schema. In this recipe, you will learn how to set up
the Netlify deployment schema on any Vue-based application.

Getting ready

The prerequisites for this recipe are as follows:

Node.js 12+
A Vue project

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

How to do it...

In this recipe, we will learn how to prepare our application to be deployed to
Netlify:

1. Open your Vue project and open the package.json file. Check whether

you have the build script defined, as in the following example:

"scripts": {
"serve": "Vue-CLI-service serve",
"build": "Vue-CLI-service build",
"lint": "Vue-CLI-service lint"
},


2. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm run build

3. Make sure your application build script creates a dist folder in the main

folder.

4. If your vue-router is defined to work with history mode, you have to

create a _redirects file in the public folder. In this file, you need to add
the instruction to the Netlify router:

# Netlify settings for single-page application
/*    /index.html   200

5. Publish your application to a GitHub repository. Don't worry about the
build folder, because it's already declared on the .gitignore file and it
won't be sent to your repository.

How it works...

In this recipe, we learned how to check and prepare our application for the
Netlify deployment.

To make the deployment work, we needed to make sure that we have the
build command in the script section at package.json, and verify that the build
destination is the dist folder.

Finally, we created a _redirects file in the public folder to instruct the Netlify
router to understand the vue-router history mode.

Preparing for automatic
deployment on Netlify with GitHub

It's time to prepare the ground for deployment. In this recipe, you will learn
how to set up the Netlify deployment process to fetch your application
automatically on GitHub and deploy it.

Getting ready

The prerequisites for this recipe are as follows:

A Netlify account
A Vue project
A GitHub account

How to do it...

Finally, following the creation of your Netlify account, having published
your project on a GitHub repository, and having configured everything, it's
time to prepare the Netlify platform to perform automatic deployment on
each GitHub push:

1. Go to Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/), sign in, and open your initial

dashboard. There, you will find a New site from Git button. You will be
redirected to the Create new site page.

2. Now you may click on the GitHub button to open a new window for the

Netlify authorization on GitHub and continue the process there.

3. Sign in with your GitHub account and then you will be redirected to the

Application install page.

4. On this page, you can choose to give access to Netlify to all of your

repositories or just the selected one, but make sure you make available
the repository of your application.


5. When you finish the installation of Netlify on GitHub, the repository
that you gave access to in the previous step will be available to be
selected on the Netlify platform. Choose the one that contains your
application.

6. To finish the creation process, you need to select the branch that will be
used for auto-deployment. Then, you need to fill up the build command
used on the application, in our case, npm run build. Open the folder that
will contain the built files, in our case, this is the dist folder, and click
on the Deploy site button.

7. Finally, the Netlify-CLI will start the building process and publish your

application when the build is finished without any errors.

How it works...

The Netlify platform connects to your GitHub account and installs as an
application, giving access to selected repositories. Then, on the platform,
you can select the repository that you want to use to deploy. With the
repository selected, we needed to configure the Netlify-CLI with the build
instructions and the built destination folder. Finally, the CLI runs, and we
have our application up and running on the web.

Creating a Vercel account

Vercel is a famous platform for deploying your application on the web. With
Vercel, you can automate the deployment process with GitHub, GitLab, and
BitBucket. In this recipe, we will learn how to create our account on the
Vercel platform.

Getting ready


The prerequisite for this recipe is just one of the following options:

A GitHub account
A GitLab account
A BitBucket account

How to do it...

Let's start our journey on the Vercel platform. Here, we will learn how to
create our account on the platform to start our project deployment:

1. Open the Vercel website (https://vercel.com/) and click on the Sign Up
button on the top bar. You will be redirected to the Sign Up page.

2. Here, you have the option to select one of these repository managers –

GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. We will continue by clicking on
the GitHub button. After choosing the sign-up method, you will be
redirected to the authorization page.

3. On this page, you are giving access to the Vercel platform to access the
information on your account. By clicking on the Authorize button, you
will be redirected back to the Vercel dashboard.

4. Finally, you have your Vercel account created and ready to be used.

How it works...

In this recipe, we entered the Vercel platform, and signed up to it using a
repository manager. We were able to create our account, and can now start
the deployment process on the platform through repository integration or the
CLI tool.

Configuring the Vercel-CLI and
deploying your project

You have created a Vercel account. Now it's time to configure the Vercel-
CLI on your project, so it's available on the Vercel platform and on the web.

Getting ready

The prerequisites for this recipe are as follows:

A Vercel account
A Vue project
Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

vercel

To install vercel, you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> npm i -g vercel

How to do it...

In this recipe, we will learn how to link our project to the Vercel platform
through the Vercel-CLI and then deploy the platform with it:

1. Open your Vue project and then open the package.json file. Check

whether you have the build script defined, as in the following example:

"scripts": {
"serve": "Vue-CLI-service serve",
"build": "Vue-CLI-service build",


"lint": "Vue-CLI-service lint"
},

2. Make sure your application build script creates a dist folder in the main

folder.

3. In your project folder, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vercel

This will prompt you for a login to the Vercel platform:

> No existing credentials found. Please log in:
Enter your email:

4. Enter the email address that is linked to the repository manager that you
have used to sign in to Vercel. You will receive an email with a Verify
button; click on it to verify your email address:

5. Once your email is verified, you are able to deploy applications in your

Terminal with the > vercel command.

6. To deploy your application to the web, we need to execute the > vercel
command in the project folder, and it will ask some questions about the
project settings prior to deployment. The first question will relate to the
project path:

? Set up and deploy "~/Versionamento/Vue.js-3.0-Cookbook/chapter-
14/14.5"? [Y/n] y

7. Now it will ask for the scope that will deploy the project. This is used

when you have multiple account access options defined under the same
username. In most of the scenarios, it will only have one, and you can
press Enter:

? Set up and deploy "~/Versionamento/Vue.js-3.0-Cookbook/chapter-
14/14.5"? y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to?
❯ Heitor Ramon Ribeiro

8. Then, it will ask to link to an existing project on Vercel. In our case, this

is a brand new project, so we will choose n:

? Link to existing project? [Y/n] n


9. You will be asked to define the project's name (only lowercase

alphanumeric characters and hyphens are allowed):

? What's your project's name? vuejscookbook-12-5

10. You now need to define the location of the source code of the project.
This location is where the package.json file is located; in our case, this
will be the ./ folder, or the main project folder:

? In which directory is your code located? ./

11. Vercel-CLI will detect that the project is a Vue-CLI project, and will
automatically define all the commands and directory settings for the
deployment of the application. We will choose n in our case:

Auto-detected Project Settings (Vue.js):
- Build Command: `npm run build` or `Vue-CLI-service build`
- Output Directory: dist
- Development Command: Vue-CLI-service serve --port $PORT
? Want to override the settings? [y/N] n

12. Once everything is set up, the CLI will deploy the first preview of your
application, and you will receive a link to access the preview of your
application. To deploy your application as production-ready, you need
to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vercel --prod

How it works...

In this recipe, we learned how to connect the Vercel-CLI to the online
platform with the email address that is linked to the repository manager, and
set up project deployment.

In this process, we learned how to configure the advanced options of the CLI
by defining the project settings for the build commands, distribution folder,
and development command.

Finally, we were able to get the preview URL of our project before
deploying it to production.

Preparing for automatic
deployment on Vercel with GitHub

We learned in the previous recipe how to use the Vercel-CLI to deploy our
application to the web using your local terminal, but it is possible to
integrate the repository manager with the Vercel platform and deploy
automatically through any push or open pull requests. That's what we will do
in this recipe.

Getting ready

The prerequisites for this recipe are as follows:

A Vercel account
A Vue project on a repository manager

How to do it...

In this recipe, we will learn how to integrate the Vercel platform with the
repository manager and make an automatic deployment:

1. Open your Vercel dashboard (https://vercel.com/dashboard) and click on

the Import Project button.


2. On the Import Project page, click on the Continue button inside the

From Git Repository card.

3. Now, the Vercel website will ask whether the user who holds the

repository of the project you are importing is your personal account.
Click Yes if it is. If it isn't, Vercel will fork the project into your
personal account before starting the process.

4. Then, Vercel will ask which account you want to bind the project to. In
our case, this will be our personal account. Select it, and click on the
Continue button.

5. You will be redirected to the GitHub web page, to give Vercel access to
your repositories. You can give access to all your repositories, or just
the ones you want to deploy. In our case, we will give access to all the
repositories on our account.

6. After installing the Vercel application on your GitHub account, you will
be sent back to the Vercel web page. Here, you can define the settings
for the project you are creating, including the project name, the preset
you are using, build instructions, and environment variables. Vercel will
automatically detect that our project is a Vue-CLI project and will
configure the build and deployment settings for us. Then, click on the
Deploy button to continue.

7. Vercel will start the first deployment process. When it's finished, Vercel
will give you the link for the application, along with a link for you to
open the dashboard.

How it works...

The Vercel platform connects to your GitHub account and installs as an
application, giving access to selected repositories. Then, on the platform,
you can select the repository that you want to use to deploy.

With the repository selected, you need to configure the Vercel-CLI with the
build instructions and the built destination folder.

Finally, the CLI runs, and we have our application up and running on the
web.

Creating a Firebase project

Firebase is an all-in-one solution created by Google to help developers with
dedicated tools for analytics, notifications, machine learning, and cloud
solutions. One of the cloud solutions they provide is the hosting platform.

With the hosting platform, we are able to host our single-page applications in
the Google cloud servers and have them available to everyone, through a
global content delivery network.

Getting ready

The prerequisites for this recipe are as follows:

A Google account
A Vue project

How to do it...

In this recipe, we will learn how to create our Firebase project so that we can
deploy our application to the Firebase hosting:

1. Open the Firebase home page (https://firebase.google.com/) and click on
the Sign In link in the header menu. If you are already logged in to
your Google account, click on the Go to console link.

2. On the Console page, click on the Create a project button to create a

new Firebase project.

3. Firebase will ask for the project name (you can only use alphanumeric

characters and spaces).


4. Then, Firebase will ask whether you want to enable Google Analytics

in this project. In our case, we will disable this option.

5. Finally, you will be redirected to the project overview dashboard.

How it works...

In this recipe, we created our first Firebase project. To do it, we started by
signing in to our Google account and going to the Firebase console. On the
Firebase console, we created a new project, and in the setup wizard steps, we
disabled the Google Analytics options because we won't be using attached
analytics in this recipe. Finally, when we finished the setup wizard, our
project was ready.

Configuring the Firebase-CLI and
deploying your project

To deploy our application to Firebase Hosting, we need to use the Firebase-
CLI. The CLI will help with the process of packing the files and sending
them to the Google Cloud server.

In this recipe, we will learn how to configure the Firebase-CLI to deploy
your application to the web using your local terminal.

Getting ready

The prerequisites for this recipe are as follows:

A Google account


A Vue project
A Firebase project
Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

firebase-tools

To install firebase-tools, you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> npm install -g firebase-tools

How to do it...

In this recipe, we will learn how to set up the Firebase-CLI on our project,
and how to initialize it with our project created during the previous recipe:

1. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command on
the root folder of your project:

> firebase login

2. The Firebase-CLI will open a browser window so you can log in to

your Google account, and give access on the part of the Firebase-CLI to
your Google Account. (If the browser doesn't open automatically, a link
will appear on the Firebase-CLI, copy the link, and then paste it into
your browser to continue.)

3. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command on
the root folder of your project:

> firebase init


4. Now we are initializing the configuration process of the CLI with our
project. For the first question of the CLI, we are going to use just the
Hosting feature, so we need to select just Hosting:

? Which Firebase CLI features do you want to set up
for this folder?
Press space to select feature, then Enter to confirm
your choices.
Database: Deploy Firebase Realtime Database Rules
Firestore: Deploy rules and create indexes for Firestore
Functions: Configure and deploy Cloud Functions
❯  Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites
Storage: Deploy Cloud Storage security rules
Emulators: Set up local emulators for Firebase features

5. Then, the CLI will ask which Firebase project we want to use. In our
case, we created the project earlier in the previous recipe, so we will
select Use an existing project:

? Use an existing project
❯ Use an existing project
Create a new project
Add Firebase to an existing Google Cloud Platform project
Don't set up a default project

6. Now a list of available projects on your account will appear. Select the

one you want to use to deploy with this application:

? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: (Use arrow
keys)
❯ vue-3-cookbook-firebase-18921 (Vue 3 Cookbook Firebase)

7. The CLI will ask about the public directory of the application, or in our
case, because it's a single-page application, we need to use the build
destination folder. Type the name of the destination folder, in our case
it's dist:

? What do you want to use as your project public directory? dist

8. Finally, the last step in the process is to select whether we want to use

the configuration as a single-page application. Type y to enable rewrites
of all the URLs to index.html so we can use the history mode of vue-
router:

? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)?
(y/N) y


9. Open the package.json file on the root directory of your project, and add a

new script to automate the build and deployment process:

"scripts": {
"serve": "Vue-CLI-service serve",
"build": "Vue-CLI-service build",
"deploy": "npm run build && firebase deploy",
"lint": "Vue-CLI-service lint"
},

10. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command on
the root folder of your project:

> npm run deploy

Now your project is deployed and available on the web, and the CLI will
give you the links to access it:


How it works...

In this recipe, we learned how to configure the Firebase CLI and to deploy
our application.

First, we installed the Firebase-CLI and signed in to the Google
authentication platform. Then, we were able to initialize the CLI in our
project folder.

In the process, we selected the project we created in the previous recipe and
pointed the building folder to the corrected one on a Vue-CLI project.


Then, we configured that we want to use a single-page application router
structure, and added a deployment script to package.json. Finally, we were able
to deploy our application and make it available to everyone.

Directives, Plugins, SSR, and More

Now you are in the Pro League! You are an advanced Vue developer. Let's
have some fun and check out some great recipes that are custom made for
you! Here are some hand-picked optimization solutions that can improve
the quality of your Vue application and make your life easier.

In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:

Automatically loading vue-router routes
Automatically loading vuex modules
Creating a custom directive
Creating a Vue plugin
Creating an SSR, SPA, PWA, Cordova, and Electron application in
Vue with Quasar
Creating smarter Vue watchers and computed properties

The dos and don'ts of Vue applications

Technical requirements

In this chapter, we will be using Node.js, Vue-
CLI, Cordova, Electron, Quasar, Nuxt.js, and Python.

Attention Windows users: you are required to install an npm package called windows-
build-tools to be able to install the following required packages. To do so, open
PowerShell as an Administrator and execute the following command:
> npm install -g windows-build-tools

To install Vue-CLI, you need to execute the following command in
Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows):

> npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global


To install Cordova, you need to execute the following command
in Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows):

> npm install -g cordova

If you are running on a macOS and you want to run an iOS simulator, you
need to execute the following command in Terminal (macOS):

> npm install -g ios-sim ios-deploy

To install Electron, you need to execute the following command in
Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows):

> npm install -g electron

To install Quasar, you need to execute the following command in
Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows):

> npm install -g @quasar/cli

To install Nuxt.js, you need to execute the following command in
Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows):

> npm install -g create-nuxt-app

Automatically loading Vue routes

In order to create maintainable code, we can use the strategy of auto-
importing files that have the same structure in our project. Like the routes
in vue-router, when the application gets larger, we find a huge amount of
files being imported and handled manually. In this recipe, we will learn a
trick to use the webpack require.context function to automatically inject files
for us.


This function will read the file content and add the routes to an array that
will be exported into our file by default. You can improve this recipe by
adding a more controlled route import or even environment-based route
rules.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

We will need to create a new Vue project with Vue-CLI, or use the project
created in previous recipes:

1. We need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create router-import

2. The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the

project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to
continue, and the spacebar to select an option.

3. There are two methods for starting a new project. The default method
is a basic babel and eslint project without any plugins or configuration,
and the Manually mode, where you can select more modes, plugins,
linters, and options. We will go for Manually:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
default (babel, eslint)
❯ Manually select features

4. Now we are asked about the features that we want on the project.

Those features are some Vue plugins such as Vuex or Router (vue-router),


testers, linters, and more. Select Babel, Router, and Linter / Formatter:

? Check the features needed for your project: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Babel
TypeScript
Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
❯ Router
Vuex
CSS Pre-processors
❯ Linter / Formatter
Unit Testing
E2E Testing

5. Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatter. In our case,

we will select the ESLint + Airbnb config:

? Pick a linter / formatter config: (Use arrow keys)
ESLint with error prevention only
❯ ESLint + Airbnb config
ESLint + Standard config
ESLint + Prettier

6. After the linting rules are set, we need to define when they are applied

to your code. They can be either applied on save or fixed on commit:

? Pick additional lint features: (Use arrow keys)
Lint on save
❯ Lint and fix on commit

7. After all those plugins, linters, and processors are defined, we need to
choose where the settings and configs are stored. The best place to
store them is in a dedicated file, but it is also possible to store them
in package.json:

? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? (Use
arrow keys)
❯ In dedicated config files
In package.json

8. Now you can choose whether you want to make this selection a preset

for future projects so that you don't need to reselect everything:

? Save this as a preset for future projects? (y/N) n

Vue-CLI will create the project, and automatically install the packages for us.


If you want to check the project on vue-ui when the installation has finished,
open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue ui

Or you can run the built-in npm commands by opening Terminal (macOS or
Linux) or the Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute one of
the following commands:

npm run serve – To run a development server locally
npm run build – To build and minify the application for deployment
npm run lint – To execute the lint on the code

How to do it...

Follow these instructions to create an auto-import of the router files in your
project that will handle the router files inside a specific folder:

1. With our route files created and placed inside the routes folder, we need
to make sure that every route file has a default export object in it. In the
index.js file, inside the src/router folder, remove the default array of
routes that is present in the file:

import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';

Vue.use(VueRouter);

export default new VueRouter({});

2. Now create an empty array of routes that will be populated by the

imported ones from the folder, and start the import. With
that, requireRoutes will be an object with the keys being the filename and
the values being the ID of the file:

import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';

Vue.use(VueRouter);

const routes = [];
const requireRoutes = require.context(






'./routes',
true,
/^(?!.*test).*\.js$/is,
);

const router = new VueRouter({
routes,
});

export default router;

3. To push those files inside the routes array, we need to add the following

code and create a folder named routes inside the router folder:

import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';

Vue.use(VueRouter);

const routes = [];
const requireRoutes = require.context(
'./routes',
true,
/^(?!.*test).*\.js$/is,
);

requireRoutes.keys().forEach((fileName) => {
routes.push({
...requireRoutes(fileName).default,
});
});

const router = new VueRouter({
routes,
});

export default router;

Now you have your routes loaded on your application automatically as you
create a new .js file inside the routes folder.

How it works...

require.context is a webpack built-in function that allows you to pass in a
directory to search, a flag indicating whether subdirectories should be
examined too, and a regular expression to match files.

When the building process starts, webpack will search for all the
require.context functions and will pre-execute them, so the files needed on
the import will be there for the final build.









We pass three arguments to the function: the first is the folder where it will
start the search, the second asks whether the search will go to descending
folders, and finally, the third is a regular expression for filename matching.

In this recipe, to automatically load the routes as the first argument of the
function, we define ./routes for the folder. As the second argument of the
function, we define false to not search in subdirectories. Finally, as the third
argument, we define /^(?!.*test).*\.js$/is as the Regex to search for .js files
and ignore the files that have .test in their names.

There's more...

With this recipe, it's possible to take your application to the next level by
using the subdirectories for router modules and environments for router
control.

With those increments, the function may be extracted to another file, but in
router.js, it still needs to be imported into the main.js file. Or, you can obtain
the import function, and pass the array of routes to router.js.

Automatically loading Vuex
modules

Sometimes, when we are working on a big project, we need to manage a lot
of imported Vuex modules and stores. To handle those modules, we always
need to import them by creating a file that will have all the files imported
and then export those to the Vuex store creation.


In this recipe, we will learn about a function that uses the
webpack require.context function to automatically load and inject those files
into the Vuex store creation.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

npm run lint  – To execute the lint on the code

How to do it...

Follow these instructions to create an auto-import of the vuex modules in
your project that will handle the router files inside a specific folder:

1. With our route files created and placed inside the store folder, we need
to make sure that every store file has a default export object in it. In
the index.js file, inside the src/store folder, we will need to extract the
array of stores or modules:

import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';

Vue.use(Vuex);

export default new Vuex.Store({});

2. Create another file named loader.js in the src/store folder (which will be

our module loader). It's important to remember that when using this
recipe, you will use vuex namespaced because all the stores need to be
used as a module and need to be exported in a single JavaScript
object. Each filename will be used as a reference to a namespace, and
it will be parsed to a camelCase text style:

const toCamel = (s) => s.replace(/([-_][a-z])/ig, (c) =>
c.toUpperCase()
.replace(/[-_]/g, ''));
const requireModule = require.context('./modules/', false,
/^(?!.*test).*\.js$/is);
const modules = {};

requireModule.keys().forEach((fileName) => {
const moduleName = toCamel(fileName.replace(/(\.\/|\.js)/g, ''));






modules[moduleName] = {
namespaced: true,
...requireModule(fileName).default,
};
});

export default modules;

3. As we will be importing by default each file inside the modules folder, a
good practice is to create a file for each module. For example, as you
will be creating a module named user, you need to create a file
named user.js that imports all the stores actions, mutations, getters, and
state. Those can be placed inside a folder that has the same name as the
module. The modules folder will have a structure similar to this:

modules
├── user.js
├── user
│ └── types.js
│   └── state.js
│   └── actions.js
│   └── mutations.js
│   └── getters.js
└───────

The user.js file inside the src/store/modules folder will look like this:

import state from './user/state';
import actions from './user/actions';
import mutations from './user/mutations';
import getters from './user/getters';

export default {
state,
actions,
mutations,
getters,
};

4. In the index.js file in the src/store folder, we need to add the imported

modules that were automatically loaded:

import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';
import modules from './loader';

Vue.use(Vuex);

export default new Vuex.Store({
modules,
});






Now you have your vuex modules loaded on your application automatically
as you create a new .js file inside the src/store/modules folder.

How it works...

require.context is a webpack built-in function that receives a directory to
execute a search, a Boolean flag indicating whether subdirectories are
included in this search, and a regular expression for the pattern matching for
the filename (all as arguments).

When the building process starts, webpack will search for all
the require.context functions, and will pre-execute them, so the files needed
on the import will be there for the final build.

In our case, we passed ./modules for the folder, false to not search in
subdirectories, and /^(?!.*test).*\.js$/is as the Regex to search for .js files
and ignore the files that have .test in their names.

Then, the function will search for the files and will pass the result through a
for loop to add the content of the files in the array of vuex modules.

Creating a custom directive

Talking about visual frameworks such as Vue, we always think about
components, rendering, and visual elements, and we forget that there are a
lot of things besides the components themselves.


There are the directives that make the components work with the template
engine, which are the binding agents between the data and the visual result.
And there are built-in directives in the core of Vue, such as v-if, v-else,
and v-for.

In this recipe, we will learn how to make our directive.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

We will need to create a new Vue project with Vue-CLI, or use the project

If you want to check the project on vue-ui when the installation has finished,
open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command

one of the following commands:

npm run serve – To run a development server locally
npm run build  – To build and minify the application for deployment
npm run lint  – To execute the lint on the code

How to do it...

Follow these instructions to create a directive for a masked input field:

1. Create a file named formMaskInputDirective.js in the src/directives folder,

and a file named tokens.js in the same folder.

2. In the tokens.js file, we will add our mask base tokens. Those tokens

will be used to identify the kind of value our input will accept:

export default {
"#": { pattern: /[\x2A\d]/ },
0: { pattern: /\d/ },
9: { pattern: /\d/ },
X: { pattern: /[0-9a-zA-Z]/ },
S: { pattern: /[a-zA-Z]/ },
A: { pattern: /[a-zA-Z]/, transform: v => v.toLocaleUpperCase() },
a: { pattern: /[a-zA-Z]/, transform: v => v.toLocaleLowerCase() },
"!": { escape: true }
};

3. We import the token from token.js and create our functions:

import tokens from './tokens';

function maskerValue() {
// Code will be developed in this recipe
}

function eventDispatcher() {
// Code will be developed in this recipe




}

function maskDirective() {
// Code will be developed in this recipe
}

export default maskDirective;

4. In the maskDirective function, we will need to check for the binding

value on the directive that is passed by the callee of the directive and
check whether it's a valid binding. To do so, we will first check
whether the value property is present on the binding argument, and then
add it to the config variable with the tokens that were imported:

function maskDirective(el, binding) {
let config;

if (!binding.value) return false;

if (typeof config === 'string') {
config = {
mask: binding.value,
tokens,
};
} else {
throw new Error('Invalid input entered');
}

5. Now we need to check for the element and validate whether it's

an input HTML element. To do so, we will check whether the element
that was passed down by the directive has a tagName of input, and if it
doesn't, we will try to find an input HTML element in the element that
was passed down:

let element = el;

if (element.tagName.toLocaleUpperCase() !== 'INPUT') {
const els = element.getElementsByTagName('input');

if (els.length !== 1) {
throw new Error(`v-input-mask directive requires 1 input,
found ${els.length}`);
} else {
[element] = els;
}
}

6. Now we need to add an event listener to the input on the element. The

listener will call two external functions, one for dispatching the
events and another to return the masked value to the input:








element.oninput = (evt) => {
if (!evt.isTrusted) return;
let position = element.selectionEnd;

const digit = element.value[position - 1];
element.value = maskerValue(element.value, config.mask,
config.tokens);
while (
position < element.value.length
&& element.value.charAt(position - 1) !== digit
) {
position += 1;
}
if (element === document.activeElement) {
element.setSelectionRange(position, position);
setTimeout(() => {
element.setSelectionRange(position, position);
}, 0);
}
element.dispatchEvent(eventDispatcher('input'));
};

const newDisplay = maskerValue(element.value, config.mask,
config.tokens);
if (newDisplay !== element.value) {
element.value = newDisplay;
element.dispatchEvent(eventDispatcher('input'));
}

return true;
}
// end of maskDirective function

7. Let's create the eventDispatcher function; this function will emit the

events that will be listened to by the v-on directive:

function eventDispatcher(name) {
const evt = document.createEvent('Event');

evt.initEvent(name, true, true);

return evt;
}

8. And now the complicated part: returning the masked input value to the
input. To do so, we will need to create the maskerValue function. This
function receives the value, mask, and token as parameters. The
function checks for the current value against the mask, to see whether
the mask is complete or the value is of a valid token. If everything's
okay, it will pass the value to the input:

function maskerValue(v, m, tkn) {
const value = v || '';








const mask = m || '';

let maskIndex = 0;

let valueIndex = 0;

let output = '';

while (maskIndex < mask.length && valueIndex < value.length) {
let maskCharacter = mask[maskIndex];
const masker = tkn[maskCharacter];
const valueCharacter = value[valueIndex];

if (masker && !masker.escape) {
if (masker.pattern.test(valueCharacter)) {
output += masker.transform ?
masker.transform(valueCharacter) : valueCharacter;
maskIndex += 1;
}

valueIndex += 1;
} else {
if (masker && masker.escape) {
maskIndex += 1;
maskCharacter = mask[maskIndex];
}

output += maskCharacter;

if (valueCharacter === maskCharacter) valueIndex += 1;

maskIndex += 1;
}
}

let outputRest = '';
while (maskIndex < mask.length) {
const maskCharacter = mask[maskIndex];

if (tkn[maskCharacter]) {
outputRest = '';
break;
}

outputRest += maskCharacter;

maskIndex += 1;
}

return output + outputRest;
}
//end of maskerValue function

9. With our file ready, we need to import the mask directive in

the main.js file and add the directive to Vue, giving the directive the
name 'input-mask':
















import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import InputMaskDirective from './directives/formMaskInputDirective';

Vue.config.productionTip = false;

Vue.directive('input-mask', InputMaskDirective);

new Vue({
render: (h) => h(App),
}).$mount('#app');

10. To use the directive on our application, we need to call the directive on

an input HTML element inside a single file component <template>
section, passing the token template '###-###-###' in the v-input-mask
directive like this:

<template>
<div id="app">
<input
type="text"
v-input-mask="'###-###-###'"
v-model="inputMask"
/>
</div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
name: 'app',
data: () => ({
inputMask: '',
}),
};
</script>

How it works...

A Vue directive has five possible hooks. We used just one, bind. It's bound
directly to the element and component. It gets three
arguments: element, binding, and vnode.

When we add the directive in the main.js file to Vue, we make it available
everywhere in our application, so the directive is already at App.vue to be
used by the input.

At the same time we call v-input-mask on the input element, we pass the first
argument, element, to the directive, and the second argument, binding, is the






value of the attribute.

Our directive works by checking each new character value on the input. A
Regex test is executed and validates the character to see whether it is a valid
character on the token list that was given on the directive instantiation.
Then, it returns the character if it passes the test, or returns nothing if it's an
invalid character.

Creating a Vue plugin

Sometimes a new addition to your application is needed, and this addition
needs to be shared. The best way to share it is by using a plugin. In Vue, a
plugin is an addition to the Vue global prototype by extending the
initialized application with new features such as directives, mixings, filters,
prototype injection, or totally new functions.

Now we will learn how to make our plugin, and how we can use it to
interact with Vue as a whole (without messing with the prototype and
breaking it).

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global objects that are required are as follows:

@vue/cli

@vue/cli-service-global

We will need to create a new Vue project with the Vue-CLI, or use the project
created in previous recipes:


1. We need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command

Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue create vue-plugin

2. The CLI will ask some questions that will help with the creation of the

project. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to
continue, and the spacebar to select an option.

3. There are two methods for starting a new project. The default method
is a basic babel and eslint project without any plugins or configuration,
and the Manually mode, where you can select more modes, plugins,
linters, and options. We will go for Manually:

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
default (babel, eslint)
❯ Manually select features

4. Now we are asked about the features that we want on the project.

Those features are some Vue plugins such as Vuex or Router (vue-router),
testers, linters, and more. Select Babel, and Linter / Formatter:

? Check the features needed for your project: (Use arrow keys)
❯  Babel
TypeScript
Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
Router
Vuex
CSS Pre-processors
❯  Linter / Formatter
Unit Testing
E2E Testing

5. Continue this process by selecting a linter and formatter. In our case,

we will select the ESLint + Airbnb config:

? Pick a linter / formatter config: (Use arrow keys)
ESLint with error prevention only
❯ ESLint + Airbnb config
ESLint + Standard config
ESLint + Prettier

6. After the linting rules are set, we need to define when they are applied

to your code. They can be either applied on save or fixed on commit:


? Pick additional lint features: (Use arrow keys)
Lint on save
❯  Lint and fix on commit

7. After all those plugins, linters, and processors are defined, we need to
choose where the settings and configs are stored. The best place to
store them is in a dedicated file, but it is also possible to store them
in package.json:

? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? (Use
arrow keys)
❯ In dedicated config files
In package.json

8. Now you can choose whether you want to make this selection a preset

for future projects, so you don't need to reselect everything:

? Save this as a preset for future projects? (y/N) n

Vue-CLI will create the project, and automatically install the packages for us.

If you want to check the project on vue-ui when the installation has finished,
open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> vue ui

Or, you can run the built-in npm commands by opening Terminal (macOS
or Linux) or the Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and executing
one of the following commands:

npm run serve – To run a development server locally
npm run build  – To build and minify the application for deployment
npm run lint  – To execute the lint on the code

How to do it...

Writing a Vue plugin is simple, and there is no need to learn more about
Vue itself. The basic concept of a plugin is an object that needs to have an
install function, which will be executed when called by the Vue.use()


method. The install function will receive two arguments: Vue, and the
options that will be used to instantiate the plugin.

Follow these instructions to write a plugin that adds two new functions to
the Vue global prototype, $localStorage and $sessionStorage:

1. In our project, we need to create a file inside the src/plugin folder

named storageManipulator.js.

2. In this file, we will create the plugin installation object – we'll add the

default plugin options and the base prototype for the functions:

/* eslint no-param-reassign: 0 */

const defaultOption = {
useSaveFunction: true,
useRetrieveFunction: true,
onSave: value => JSON.stringify(value),
onRetrieve: value => JSON.parse(value),
};

export default {
install(Vue, option) {
const baseOptions = {
...defaultOption,
...option,
};

Vue.prototype.$localStorage = generateStorageObject(
window.localStorage,
baseOptions,
); // We will add later this code

Vue.prototype.$sessionStorage = generateStorageObject(
window.localStorage,
baseOptions,
); // We will add later this code
},
};

3. Now we need to create the generateStorageObject function. This function

will receive two arguments: the first will be the window storage object,
and the second will be the plugin options. With this, it will be possible
to generate the object that will be used on the prototype that will be
injected into Vue:

const generateStorageObject = (windowStorage, options) => ({
set(key, value) {
windowStorage.setItem(
key,
options.useSaveFunction






? options.onSave(value)
: value,
);
},

get(key) {
const item = windowStorage.getItem(key);
return options.useRetrieveFunction ? options.onRetrieve(item) :
item;
},

remove(key) {
windowStorage.removeItem(key);
},

clear() {
windowStorage.clear();
},
});

4. We need to import the plugin into the main.js, and then with the Vue.use

function, install the plugin in our Vue application:

import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import StorageManipulatorPlugin from './plugin/storageManipulator';

Vue.config.productionTip = false;

Vue.use(StorageManipulatorPlugin);

new Vue({
render: h => h(App),
}).$mount('#app');

Now you can use the plugin anywhere in your Vue application, calling the
this.$localStorage method or this.$sessionStorage.

How it works...

The Vue plugin works by adding all the code that was instructed to be
used to the Vue application layer (like a mixin).

When we used Vue.use() to import our plugin, we told Vue to call the
install() function on the object of the imported file and executed it. Vue
will automatically pass the current Vue as the first argument, and the
options (if you declare them) as the second argument.








In our plugin, when the install() function is called, we first
create baseOptions, merging the default options with the passed parameter,
then we inject two new properties into the Vue prototype. Those properties
are now available everywhere because the Vue parameter that was passed is
the Vue global being used in the application.

Our generateStorageObject is a pure abstraction of the Storage API of the
browser. We use it as a generator for our prototypes inside the plugin.

Creating an SSR, SPA, PWA,
Cordova, and Electron application
in Vue with Quasar

Quasar is a framework based on Vue and Material Design that takes
advantage of "write once, use everywhere."

The CLI can deploy the same code base to different flavors, such as Single-
Page Application (SPA), Server-Side Rendering (SSR),
Progressive Web Application (PWA), Mobile Application (Cordova),
and Desktop Application (Electron).

This takes some of the problems away from the developer, such as
configuring webpack, Cordova, and Electron with HMR (Hot Module
Reload) for development, or adding an SSR configuration in the SPA


project. The framework helps the developer start production as soon as
possible.

In this recipe, we will learn how to use Quasar and the CLI to create a basic
project, and how to use the CLI to add the development targets for SPA,
PWA, SSR, Mobile Application, and Desktop Application.

Getting ready

The pre-requisite for this recipe is as follows:

Node.js 12+

The Node.js global object that is required is as follows:

@quasar/cli

We will need to create a new Quasar project with the Quasar CLI, or use the
project created in previous recipes.

To do it, open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> quasar create quasar-project

Now, when asked, we need to choose to manually select features:

1. Quasar-CLI will ask you for a project name. Define your project name. In

our case, we choose quasar_project:

> Project name: quasar_project

2. Then Quasar-CLI will ask for a project product name. This will be used

by mobile apps to defined their title name. In our case, we stayed with
the default name provided:

> Project product name (must start with letter if building mobile
apps) (Quasar App)


3. Now Quasar-CLI will ask for a project description. This is used for a

meta tag in search engines when the page is shared. In our case, we
used the default description provided:

> Project description: (A Quasar Framework app)

4. Then Quasar-CLI will ask for the project author. Fill this with a

package.json valid name (for example, Heitor Ribeiro<heitor@example.com>):

> Author: <You>

5. Now it's time to choose the CSS preprocessor. In our case, we will go

with Sass with indented syntax:

Pick your favorite CSS preprocessor: (can be changed later) (Use arrow
keys)
❯ Sass with indented syntax (recommended)
Sass with SCSS syntax (recommended)
Stylus
None (the others will still be available)

6. Then Quasar-CLI will ask about the import strategy for the components

and directives. We will use the default auto-import strategy:

Pick a Quasar components & directives import strategy: (can be
changed later) (Use arrow keys )
❯ * Auto-import in-use Quasar components & directives - also
treeshakes Quasar; minimum bundle size
* Import everything from Quasar - not treeshaking Quasar;
biggest bundle size

7. Now we need to choose the extra features for the project. We will

select EsLint:

Check the features needed for your project: EsLint

8. After that, Quasar-CLI will ask for a preset for ESLint. Choose the Airbnb

preset:

Pick an ESLint preset: Airbnb

9. Finally, Quasar-CLI will ask for the application you want to use to install
the dependencies of the project. In our case, we used yarn because we
have installed it already (but you can choose the one you prefer):


Continue to install project dependencies after the project has been
created? (recommended) (Use arrow keys)
❯ Yes, use Yarn (recommended)
Yes, use npm
No, I will handle that myself

Now open the created folder in your IDE or code editor.

How to do it...

When using Quasar to create an application, you always need to choose a
flavor to start, but the main code will be an SPA. Therefore, the other
flavors will have their special treats and delicacies based on their needs, but
you can personalize and make your build execute some code based on the
build environment.

Developing an SPA (Single-Page Application)

Starting the development of an SPA is an out-of-the-box solution; there is
no need to add any new configuration.

So let's start adding a new page to our application. Open Terminal (macOS
or Linux) or the Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the
following command:

> quasar new page About

Quasar-CLI will automatically create the Vue page for us. We need to add the
reference to the page in the router file, and the page will be available on the
application:

1. To do it, we need to open the routes.js file in the src/router folder, and

add the About page:

const routes = [
{
path: '/',
component: () => import('layouts/MainLayout.vue'),
children: [
{ path: '', name: 'home', component: () =>
import('pages/Index.vue') },
{ path: 'about', name: 'about', component: () =>


import('pages/About.vue') },
],
},
{
path: '*',
component: () => import('pages/Error404.vue'),
}
];

export default routes;

2. Then open the About.vue file in the src/pages folder. You will find that the
file is a single file component that has an empty QPage component in it,
so we need to add a basic title and page indication in the <template>
section:

<template>
<q-page
padding
class="flex flex-start"
>
<h1 class="full-width">About</h1>
<h2>This is an About Us Page</h2>
</q-page>
</template>

<script>
export default {
name: 'PageAbout',
};
</script>

3. Now, in the MainLayout.vue file, in the src/layouts folder, to the q-drawer
component, we need to add the links to the Home and About page:

<template>
<q-layout view="lHh Lpr lFf">
<q-header elevated>
<q-toolbar>
<q-btn flat dense round
@click="leftDrawerOpen = !leftDrawerOpen"
aria-label="Menu">
<q-icon name="menu" />
</q-btn>

<q-toolbar-title>
Quasar App
</q-toolbar-title>

<div>Quasar v{{ $q.version }}</div>
</q-toolbar>
</q-header>

<q-drawer v-model="leftDrawerOpen"
bordered content-class="bg-grey-2">
<q-list>







<q-item-label header>Menu</q-item-label>
<q-item clickable tag="a" :to="{name: 'home'}">
<q-item-section avatar>
<q-icon name="home" />
</q-item-section>
<q-item-section>
<q-item-label>Home</q-item-label>
</q-item-section>
</q-item>
<q-item clickable tag="a" :to="{name: 'about'}">
<q-item-section avatar>
<q-icon name="school" />
</q-item-section>
<q-item-section>
<q-item-label>About</q-item-label>
</q-item-section>
</q-item>
</q-list>
</q-drawer>

<q-page-container>
<router-view />
</q-page-container>
</q-layout>
</template>

<script>
export default {
name: "MyLayout",
data() {
return {
leftDrawerOpen: this.$q.platform.is.desktop
};
}
};
</script>

And we are finished with a simple example of an SPA running inside
a Quasar framework.

Commands

You can run the Quasar-CLI commands by opening Terminal (macOS or
Linux) or the Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and executing one
of the following:

quasar dev – To start development mode
quasar build – To build the SPA

Developing a PWA (Progressive Web Application)





To develop a PWA, we first need to inform Quasar that we want to add a
new mode of development. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
the Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> quasar mode add pwa

Quasar-CLI will create a folder called src-pwa that will have our service-
workers files, separated from our main code.

To clean the newly added files, and to lint it into the Airbnb format, we
need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> eslint --fix --ext .js ./src-pwa

The code that we added to the SPA will still be used as our base so that we
can add new pages, components, and other functions to it as well, which
will be used on the PWA.

So, are you wondering why service-worker is not in the main src folder? This is because
those files are exclusively for PWAs, and are not needed in any other case than this one.
The same will happen in different build types, such as Electron, Cordova, and SSR.

Configuring quasar.conf on a PWA

For PWA development, you can set some special flags on
the quasar.conf.js file in the root folder:

pwa: {
// workboxPluginMode: 'InjectManifest',
// workboxOptions: {},
manifest: {
// ...
},

// variables used to inject specific PWA
// meta tags (below are default values)
metaVariables: {
appleMobileWebAppCapable: 'yes',
appleMobileWebAppStatusBarStyle: 'default',
appleTouchIcon120: 'statics/icons/apple-icon-120x120.png',
appleTouchIcon180: 'statics/icons/apple-icon-180x180.png',
appleTouchIcon152: 'statics/icons/apple-icon-152x152.png',
appleTouchIcon167: 'statics/icons/apple-icon-167x167.png',



appleSafariPinnedTab: 'statics/icons/safari-pinned-tab.svg',
msapplicationTileImage: 'statics/icons/ms-icon-144x144.png',
msapplicationTileColor: '#000000'
}
}

Commands

You can run the Quasar-CLI commands by opening Terminal (macOS or
Linux) or the Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and executing one
of the following:

quasar dev -m pwa – To start development mode as a PWA
quasar build -m pwa – To build the code as a PWA

Developing SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

To develop SSR, we first need to inform Quasar that we want to add a new
mode of development. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> quasar mode add ssr

Quasar-CLI will create a folder called src-ssr that will have
our extension and server starter files, separated from our main code.

The extension file is not transpiled by babel and runs on the Node.js context,
so it is the same environment as an Express or Nuxt.js application. You can
use server plugins, such as database, fileread, and filewrites.

The server starter files will be our index.js file in the src-ssr folder. As the
extension, it is not transpiled by babel and runs on the Node.js context. For
the HTTP server, it uses Express, and if you configure quasar.conf.js to pass
the client a PWA, you can have an SSR with PWA at the same time.

Configuring quasar.conf on SSR

For SSR development, you can configure some special flags on
the quasar.conf.js file in the root folder:


ssr: {
pwa: true/false, // should a PWA take over (default: false), or just
// a SPA?
},

Commands

You can run the Quasar-CLI commands by opening Terminal (macOS or
Linux) or the Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and executing one
of the following:

quasar dev -m ssr – To start development mode as SSR
quasar build -m ssr – To build the code as SSR
quasar serve – To run an HTTP server (can be used in production)

Developing a mobile application (Cordova)

To develop SSR, we first need to inform Quasar that we want to add a new
mode of development. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following command:

> quasar mode add cordova

Now the Quasar-CLI will ask you some configuration questions:

1. What is the Cordova app ID? (org.cordova.quasar.app)

2. May Cordova anonymously report usage statistics to improve the

tool over time? (Y/N) N

Quasar-CLI will create a folder called src-cordova, which will have a Cordova
project inside.

The folder structure of a Cordova project looks like this:

src-cordova/
├── config.xml
├── packages.json
├── cordova-flag.d.ts
├── hooks/
├── www/


├── platforms/
├── plugins/

As a separate project inside Quasar, to add Cordova plugins, you need to call plugman or
cordova plugin add command inside the src-cordova folder.

Configuring quasar.conf on Cordova

For Cordova development, you can set some special flags on the
quasar.conf.js file in the root folder:

cordova: {
iosStatusBarPadding: true/false, // add the dynamic top padding on
// iOS mobile devices
backButtonExit: true/false // Quasar handles app exit on mobile phone
// back button
},

Commands

You can run the Quasar-CLI commands by opening Terminal (macOS or
Linux) or the Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and executing one
of the following:

If you don't have a Cordova environment already configured on your desktop, you can
find more information on how to set it up here: https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/developing-cordova-a
pps/preparation#Android-setup.

quasar dev -m cordova -T android – To start development mode as an
Android Device Emulator
quasar build -m cordova -T android – To build the code as Android
quasar dev -m cordova -T ios – To start development mode as an iOS
device emulator (macOS only)
quasar build -m cordova -T ios – To start build mode as an iOS device
emulator (macOS only)

Developing a desktop application (Electron)

To develop an SSR, we first need to inform Quasar that we want to add a
new mode of development. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
the Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:


> quasar mode add electron

Quasar-CLI will create a folder called src-electron, which will have an Electron
project inside.

The folder structure for Electron projects looks like this:

src-electron/
├── icons/
├── main-process/
├── electron-flag.d.ts

Inside the icons folder, you will find the icons that electron-packager will use
when building your project. In the main-process folder will be your main
Electron files, spliced into two files: one that will only be called on
development and another that will be called on development and
production.

Configuring quasar.conf on Electron

For Electron development, you can set some special flags on
the quasar.conf.js file in the root folder:

electron: {
// optional; webpack config Object for
// the Main Process ONLY (/src-electron/main-process/)
extendWebpack (cfg) {
// directly change props of cfg;
// no need to return anything
},

// optional; EQUIVALENT to extendWebpack() but uses webpack-chain;
// for the Main Process ONLY (/src-electron/main-process/)
chainWebpack (chain) {
// chain is a webpack-chain instance
// of the Webpack configuration
},

bundler: 'packager', // or 'builder'

// electron-packager options
packager: {
//...
},

// electron-builder options
builder: {
//...






}
},

The packager key uses the API options for the electron-packager module, and the builder
key uses the API options for the electron-builder module.

Commands

You can run the Quasar-CLI commands by opening Terminal (macOS or
Linux) or the Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and executing one
of the following:

quasar dev -m electron – To start development mode as Electron
quasar build -m electron – To build the code as Electron

How it works...

This is all possible because Quasar framework encapsulates the building,
parsing, and bundling for you on the CLI. You don't need to worry about
webpack and configurations with Electron, Cordova, or even Babel.

A simple CLI command can generate an entirely new page, layout,
component, store, route, or even a new build for you. As the CLI is just a
wrapper around Vue, webpack, Babel, and other tools, you are not tied to
using only Quasar visual components. If you don't want to use them, it's
possible to not import them and use the power of the CLI for building your
application.

Creating smarter Vue watchers and
computed properties

In Vue, using watchers and computed properties is always an excellent
solution to check and cache your data, but sometimes that data needs some
special treatment or needs to be manipulated differently than expected.
There are some ways to give these Vue APIs a new life, helping your
development and productivity.

How to do it...


We will divide this recipe into two categories: one for the watchers and
another for the computed properties. Some methods are commonly used
together, such as the non-cached computed and deep-watched values.

Watchers

These three watcher recipes were selected to improve productivity and the
final code quality. The usage of these methods can reduce code duplication
and improve code reuse.

Using method names

All watchers can receive a method name instead of functions, preventing
you from writing duplicated code. This will help you avoid re-writing the
same code, or checking for values and passing them to the functions:

<script>
export default {
watch: {
myField: 'myFunction',
},
data: () => ({
myField: '',
}),
methods: {
myFunction() {
console.log('Watcher using method name.');
},
},
};
</script>

Immediate calls and deep listening

You can set your watcher to execute as soon as it is created by passing a
property immediately and make it execute no matter the value's depth of
mutation by calling the deep property:

<script>
export default {
watch: {
myDeepField: {
handler(newVal, oldVal) {
console.log('Using Immediate Call, and Deep Watch');
console.log('New Value', newVal);


console.log('Old Value', oldVal);
},
deep: true,
immediate: true,
},
},
data: () => ({
myDeepField: '',
}),
};
</script>

Multiple handlers

You can make your watcher execute various handlers at the same time,
without needing to set the watch handler to bind to a unique function:

<script>
export default {
watch: {
myMultiField: [
'myFunction',
{
handler(newVal, oldVal) {
console.log('Using Immediate Call, and Deep Watch');
console.log('New Value', newVal);
console.log('Old Value', oldVal);
},
immediate: true,
},
],
},
data: () => ({
myMultiField: '',
}),
methods: {
myFunction() {
console.log('Watcher Using Method Name');
},
},
};
</script>

Computed

Sometimes computed properties are just used as simple cache-based values,
but there is more power to them. Here are two methods that show how to
extract this power.

No cached value


You can make your computed property an always updated value, rather than
a cached value, by setting the cache property to false:

<script>
export default {
computed: {
field: {
get() {
return Date.now();
},
cache: false,
},
},
};
</script>

Getter and setter

You can add a setter function to your computed property and make it a fully
complete data attribute, but not bound to the data.

It's not recommended to do this, but it's possible, and in some cases, you
may need to do it. An example is when you have to save a date in
milliseconds, but you need to display it in an ISO format. Using this
method, you can have the dateIso property get and set the value:

<script>
export default {
data: () => ({
dateMs: '',
}),
computed: {

Creating a Nuxt.js SSR with
Python Flask as the API

Nuxt.js is a server-side rendering framework that renders everything at the
server and delivers it loaded. With this process, the page gets the power of
SEO and fast API fetching before rendering.

Using it correctly, you can achieve a powerful SPA or PWA with other
functions that weren't possible before.

In the backend, Python is an interpreted dynamic language that is fast and
stable. With an active user base and quick learning curve, this is perfect for
server APIs.

Joining both together, it is possible to get a powerful application deployed
as fast as possible.

Getting ready

The pre-requisites for this recipe are as follows:

Node.js 12+
Python

The Node.js global object that is required is as follows:

create-nuxt-app

To install create-nuxt-app, you need to execute the following command in
Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows):


> npm install -g create-nuxt-app

For the backend of this recipe, we will use Python. The Python global
objects required for this recipe are as follows:

flask

flask-restful

flask-cors

To install flask, flask-restful, and flask-cors, you need to execute the
following command in Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows):

> pip install flask
> pip install flask-restful
> pip install flask-cors

How to do it...

We will need to split our recipe into two parts. The first part is the backend
part (or API if you prefer), which will be done with Python and Flask. The
second part will be the frontend part, and it will run on Nuxt.js in SSR mode.

Creating your Flask API

Our API server will be based on the Python Flask framework. We will need
to create a server folder to store our server files and start the development
of the server.

You will need to install the following Python packages. To do so, open
Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following commands:

To install the Flask framework, use the following command:

> pip install flask

To install the Flask RESTful extension, use the following command:


> pip install flask-restful

To install the Flask CORS extension, use the following command:

> pip install flask-cors

Initializing the application

To create our simple RESTful API, we will create a single file and use
SQLite3 as a database:

1. Create a folder named server and create a file named app.py in it:

import sqlite3 as sql
from flask import Flask
from flask_restful import Resource, Api, reqparse
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)
CORS(app)

parser = reqparse.RequestParser()

conn = sql.connect('tasks.db')
conn.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (id INTEGER PRIMARY
KEY AUTOINCREMENT, task TEXT)')
conn.close()

2. Then, we will create our ToDo class, and on the constructor of the class,

we will connect to the database and select all tasks:

class ToDo(Resource):
def get(self):
con = sql.connect('tasks.db')
cur = con.cursor()
cur.execute('SELECT * from tasks')
tasks = cur.fetchall()
con.close()

return {
'tasks': tasks
}

3. To implement the RESTful POST method, create a function

that receives task as an argument, and will add an object with the task
that was added, the status of the addition to the tasks list, and then
return the list to the user:






def post(self):
parser.add_argument('task', type=str)
args = parser.parse_args()

con = sql.connect('tasks.db')
cur = con.cursor()
cur.execute('INSERT INTO tasks(task) values ("
{}")'.format(args['task']))
con.commit()
con.close()

return {
'status': True,
'task': '{} added.'.format(args['task'])
}

4. Next, we will create the RESTful PUT method by creating a function

that will receive the task and id as arguments of the function. Then, this
function will update task with the current id, and return to the user the
updated task and the status of the update:

def put(self, id):
parser.add_argument('task', type=str)
args = parser.parse_args()

con = sql.connect('tasks.db')
cur = con.cursor()
cur.execute('UPDATE tasks set task = "{}" WHERE id =
{}'.format(args['task'], id))
con.commit()
con.close()

return {
'id': id,
'status': True,
'task': 'The task {} was updated.'.format(id)
}

5. Then, create a RESTful DELETE method by creating a function that
will receive the ID of the task, which will be removed, and then will
return to the user the ID, status, and the task that was removed:

def delete(self, id):
con = sql.connect('tasks.db')
cur = con.cursor()
cur.execute('DELETE FROM tasks WHERE id = {}'.format(id))
con.commit()
con.close()

return {
'id': id,
'status': True,
'task': 'The task {} was deleted.'.format(id)
}







6. Finally, we will add the ToDo class as a resource to the API on the '/'

route, and initialize the application:

api.add_resource(ToDo, '/', '/<int:id>')

if __name__ == '__main__':
app.run(debug=True)

Starting the server

To start your server, you need to open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
the Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> python server/app.py

Your server will be running and listening on http://localhost:5000.

Creating your Nuxt.js server

To render your application, you will need to create your Nuxt.js
application. Using the Nuxt.js create-nuxt-app CLI, we will create it and
choose some options for it. Open Terminal (macOS or Linux) or
the Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and execute the following
command:

> create-nuxt-app client

Then, you will be asked some questions about the installation process. We
will use the following:

1. When you start creating your project with Nuxt-CLI, it will first ask for
the project name. In our case, we will choose client as the name:

Project Name: client

2. Then you need to choose the programming language that will be used

in the project. We will select JavaScript:

> Programming language: (Use arrow keys)
❯ JavaScript



TypeScript

3. Next, Nuxt-CLI will ask for the package manager that will be used to
install the dependencies. In our case, we choose Yarn, but you can
choose the one you prefer:

> Package manager: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Yarn
npm

4. Now, Nuxt-CLI will ask for a UI framework to be used in the project.

From the available list, choose Bulma:

> UI Framework: Bulma

5. Then, Nuxt-CLI will ask whether you want to select extra modules for
the project. We will select Axios from the current list of modules:

> Nuxt.JS modules: Axios

6. Nuxt-CLI will ask for the linting tools we want to use on our project; we

will choose None:

> Choose Linting tools: None

7. Then, Nuxt-CLI will ask for the test framework we want to implement on

our project; we will choose None:

> Choose Test Framework: None

8. Next, Nuxt-CLI will ask for the rendering mode that will be used by the

project; we will select Universal (SSR):

> Choose Rendering Mode: Universal (SSR)

9. Nuxt-CLI will ask for the deployment target that will be used on the

building structure; we will choose Server (Node.js hosting):

> Deployment target: Server (Node.js hosting)

10. Finally, Nuxt-CLI will ask for the development tool configuration that we

want to use; we will select jsconfig.json:


> Development tools: jsconfig.json

After the CLI finishes the installation process, we can open the client folder
on our editor or IDE.

Adding Bulma to the global CSS

To add Bulma to the application, we need to declare it in the nuxt
configuration file by doing the following:

1. Open nuxt.config.js, in the client folder.
2. Then, update the CSS property and add the Bulma import, to make it

available in the global scope of the application:

export default {
/* We need to change only the css property for now, */
/* the rest we will maitain the same */
/*
** Global CSS
*/
css: ['bulma/css/bulma.css'],
}

Configuring the axios plugin

To start creating our API calls, we need to add the axios plugin in our
application:

1. To do so, we will need to open the nuxt.config.js, file in the root folder,

and add the axios property:

export default {
/* We need to change only the axios property for now, */
/* the rest we will maitain the same */
axios: {},
}

2. On the axios property, add the following configuration properties:

HOST and define it as '127.0.0.1'
PORT and define it as '5000'
https and define it as false
debug and define it as true:



axios: {
HOST: '127.0.0.1',
PORT: '5000',
https: false,
debug: true, // Only on development
},

Running the Nuxt.js server

Now that you have everything set, you want to run the server and start to
see what is going on. Nuxt.js comes with some pre-programmed npm scripts
out of the box. You can run one of the following commands by opening
Terminal (macOS or Linux) or the Command
Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and executing the following:

npm run dev – To run the server in development mode
npm run build – To build the files with webpack and minify the CSS and
JS for production

npm run generate – To generate static HTML pages for each route
npm start – To start the server in production, after running the
build command

Creating the TodoList component

For the TodoList app, we will need a component that will fetch the tasks
and delete the tasks.

Single file component <script> section

Here, we will create the <script> section of the single file component:

1. In the client/components folder, create a file named TodoList.vue and open

it.

2. Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with

a name property defined as TodoList, then define the beforeMount life cycle
hook as an asynchronous function.
Define the computed and methods properties as an empty JavaScript object.
Then, create a data property defined as a singleton function returning a


JavaScript object. In the data property, create a taskList property as an
empty array:

export default {
name: 'TodoList',
data: () => ({
taskList: [],
}),
computed: {},
async beforeMount() {},
methods: {},
};

3. In the computed property, create a new property called taskObject. This

computed property will return the result of Object.fromEntries(new
Map(this.taskList)):

taskObject() {
return Object.fromEntries(new Map(this.taskList));
},

4. In the methods property, create a new method called getTask – it will be
an asynchronous function. This method will fetch the tasks from the
server, then will use the response to define the taskList property:

async getTasks() {
try {
const { tasks } = await
this.$axios.$get('http://localhost:5000');
this.taskList = tasks;
} catch (err) {
console.error(err);
}
},

5. Then, create a deleteTask method. This method will be an asynchronous
function and will receive an id as a parameter. Using this parameter, it
will execute an API execution to delete the task and then execute the
getTask method:

async deleteTask(i) {
try {
const { status } = await
this.$axios.$delete(`http://localhost:5000/${i}`);
if (status) {
await this.getTasks();
}
} catch (err) {
console.error(err);
}
},


6. Finally, in the beforeMount life cycle hook, we will execute the getTask

method:

async beforeMount() {
await this.getTasks();
},

Single file component <template> section

It's time to create the <template> section of the single file component:

1. In the client/components folder, open the TodoList.vue file.
2. In the <template> section, create a div HTML element, and add the class

attribute with the value box:

<div class="box"></div>

3. As a child of the div.box HTML element, create a div HTML element,
with the class attribute defined as content, with a child element defined
as an ol HTML element and the attribute type defined as 1:

<div class="content">
<ol type="1"></ol>
</div>

4. As a child of the ol HTML element, create a li HTML element, with

the v-for directive defined as (task, i) in taskObject, and the key attribute
defined as a variable, i:

<li
v-for="(task, i) in taskObject"
:key="i">
</li>

5. Finally, as a child of the ol HTML element, add {{ task }} as the inner
text, and as a sibling of the text, create a button HTML element, the
class attribute defined as delete is-small, and the @click event listener
defined as the deleteTask method, passing the i variable as an argument:

{{ task }}
<button
class="delete is-small"
@click="deleteTask(i)"
/>


Creating the Todo form component

To send the task to the server, we will need a form. That means we need to
make a form component that will handle this for us.

Single file component <script> section

Here, we will create the <script> section of the single file component:

1. In the client/components folder, create a file named TodoForm.vue and open

it.

2. Then, we will export a default JavaScript object, with

a name property defined as TodoForm, then define the methods property as an
empty JavaScript object. Then, create a data property defined as a
singleton function returning a JavaScript object. In the data property,
create a task property as an empty array:

export default {
name: 'TodoForm',
data: () => ({
task: '',
}),
methods: {},
};

3. In the methods property, create a method named save, which will be an

asynchronous function. This method will send the task to the API, and
if the API receives Ok Status, it will emit a 'new-task' event with the
task and clean task property:

async save() {
try {
const { status } = await
this.$axios.$post('http://localhost:5000/', {
task: this.task,
});
if (status) {
this.$emit('new-task', this.task);
this.task = '';
}
} catch (err) {
console.error(err);
}
},


Single file component <template> section

It's time to create the <template> section of the single file component:

1. In the client/components folder, open the TodoForm.vue file.

2. In the <template> section, create a div HTML element, and add

the class attribute with the value box:

<div class="box"></div>

3. Inside the div.box HTML element, create a div HTML element with the

class attribute defined as field has-addons:

<div class="field has-addons"></div>

4. Then, inside the div.field.has-addons HTML element, create a child div
HTML element, with the class attribute defined as control is-expanded,
and add a child input HTML element with the v-model directive defined
as the task property. Then, define the class attribute as input, the type
attribute as text, and placeholder as ToDo Task. Finally, in the @keypress.enter
event listener, define the save method:

<div class="control is-expanded">
<input
v-model="task"
class="input"
type="text"
placeholder="ToDo Task"
@keypress.enter="save"
>
</div>

5. Finally, as a sibling of the div.control.is-expanded HTML element, create
a div HTML element, with the class attribute defined as control, and add
a child a HTML element, with the class attribute defined as button is-
info, and on the @click event listener, define it as the save method. As
inner text of the a HTML element, add the Save Task text:

<div class="control">
<a
class="button is-info"
@click="save"
>
Save Task


</a>
</div>

Creating the layout

Now we need to create a new layout to wrap the application as a simple
high-order component. In the client/layouts folder, open the file named
default.vue, remove the <style> section of the file, and change the <template>
section to the following:

<template>
<nuxt />
</template>

Creating the page

Now we will create the main page of our application, where the user will be
able to view their TodoList and add a new TodoItem.

Single file component <script> section

Here, we will create the <script> section of the single file component:

1. Open the index.vue file in the client/pages folder.
2. Import the todo-form and the todo-list component that we created, then

we will export a default JavaScript object, with
a components property with the imported components:

<script>
import TodoForm from '../components/TodoForm.vue';
import TodoList from '../components/TodoList.vue';

export default {
components: { TodoForm, TodoList },
};
</script>

Single file component <template> section

It's time to create the <template> section of the single file component:



1. In the client/pages folder, open the index.vue file.
2. In the <template> section, create a div HTML element, add as a child a
section HTML element, with the class property defined as hero is-
primary. Then, as a child of the section HTML element, create a div
HTML element, with the class attribute defined as hero-body. As a child
of the div.hero-body HTML element, create a div HTML element with
the class attribute defined as container and add as a child an h1 HTML
element with class defined as title, with the inner text as Todo App:

<section class="hero is-primary">
<div class="hero-body">
<div class="container">
<h1 class="title">
Todo App
</h1>
</div>
</div>
</section>

3. As a sibling of the section.hero.is-primary HTML element, create a

section HTML element, with the class attribute defined as section and
the style attribute defined as padding: 1rem. Add as a child a div HTML
element with the class attribute defined as container with a child todo-
list component with the ref attribute defined as list:

<section
class="section"
style="padding: 1rem"
>
<div class="container">
<todo-list
ref="list"
/>
</div>
</section>

4. Finally, as a sibling of the section.section HTML element, create

a section HTML element, with the class attribute defined as section and
the style attribute defined as padding: 1rem. Add as a child a div HTML
element with the class attribute defined as container with a child todo-
form component, with the @new-task event listener defined
as $refs.list.getTasks():

<section
class="section"
style="padding: 1rem"
>


<div class="container">
<todo-form
@new-task="$refs.list.getTasks()"
/>
</div>
</section>

How it works...

This recipe shows the integration between a local API server via Python
and an SSR platform served via Nuxt.js.

When you start the Python server first, you are opening the ports to receive
data from clients as a passive client, just waiting for something to happen to
start your code. With the same process, the Nuxt.js SSR can do a lot of stuff
behind the scenes, but when it finishes, it goes idle, waiting for user action.

When the user interacts with the frontend, the application can send some
requests to the server that will be handed back to the user with data, to be
shown on the screen.

The dos and don'ts of Vue
applications

Security is always something everyone is worried about, and this is no
different for technology. You need to be aware and alert all the time. In this
section, we'll look at how you can prevent attacks with some techniques and
simple solutions.

Linters

When using ESLint, make sure you have enabled the Vue plugin, and you
are following the strongly recommended rules. Those rules will help you
with the development, checking for some common mistakes that can open
doors to attacks such as the v-html directive.

In a Vue-CLI project, with the options for linters selected, a file
named .eslintrc.js will be created along with the project files. In this file, a
set of basic rules will be pre-determined. The following is an example of a
set of good practice rules for an ESLint + AirBnb project:

module.exports = {
root: true,
env: {
node: true,
},
extends: [
'plugin:vue/essential',
'plugin:vue/recommended',
'plugin:vue/strongly-recommended',
'@vue/airbnb',
],
parserOptions: {
parser: 'babel-eslint',
},
rules: {
'no-console': process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'error' : 'off',
'no-debugger': process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'error' : 'off',
},
};


Now, if you have any code that breaks the lint rules, it won't be parsed on
development or build.

JavaScript

JavaScript has some vulnerabilities that can be prevented by following
some simple checklists and simple implementations. Those
implementations can be in client-server communications or DOM
manipulation, but you always need to be careful not to forget them.

Here are some tips for using JavaScript:

Always use an authenticated and encrypted API when
possible. Remember that JWT isn't encrypted by itself; you need to
add the layer of encryption (JWE) to have the whole JSON.
Always use SessionStorage if you want to store an API token.
Always sanitize the HTML input from the user before sending it to the
server.
Always sanitize the HTML before rendering it to the DOM.
Always escape any RegeExp from the user; it will be executed, to prevent
any CPU thread attack.
Always catch errors and don't show any stack trace to the user, to
prevent any code manipulation.

Here are some tips on what not to do when using JavaScript:

Never use eval(); it makes your code run slowly and opens a door for
malicious code to execute inside your code.
Never render any input from the user without any sanitization or
escaping the data.
Never render any HTML on the DOM without any sanitization.
Never store an API token on LocalStorage.
Never store sensitive data in the JWT object.

Vue


When developing a Vue application, you need to check for some basic rules
that can help the development and won't open any doors for the external
manipulation of your application.

Here are some tips for using Vue:

Always add type validation to your props, and if possible, a validator
check.
Avoid the global registration of components; use local components.
Always use lazy-loaded components, when possible.
Use $refs instead of direct DOM manipulation.

Here are some tips on what not to do when using Vue:

Never store Vue, $vm, $store, or any application variable on the window
or any global scope.
Never modify the Vue prototype; if you need to add a new variable to
the prototype, make a new Vue plugin.
It's not recommended to use a direct connection between components,
as it will make the component bound to the parent or child.
